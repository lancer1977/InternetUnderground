When did you join Internet Underground?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=92C000>
In January of 1997--a dark time when the people of Lombard, Ill. were enslaved by giant ant-like creatures and forced to work in the titanium mines beneath the Roosevelt Road Dairy Queen. (Things are much better now.)

How long have you been online?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=92C000>
Since July of 1995--just a couple of months before corporate URLs started to litter TV commercials and billboards.

What do you spend most of your time doing online?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=92C000>
Telling myself I'm going to spend just five minutes looking at a site, then sitting there for an hour reading everything on it.

How do you spend offline time?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=92C000>
Daydreaming, drawing, dancing, keeping the cat off the kitchen table. Oh, and I do watch TV on occasion (but only quality TV, like <i>The Simpsons</i> or <i>Soul Train</i>).

What was the first site that really caught your attention?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=92C000>
I remember being swept away by the action and drama of the Trojan Room Coffee Machine.

What scares you about the Internet?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=92C000>
I'm afraid the Surgeon General will determine that staring at a monitor all the time is hazardous to your health.

What best prepared you for your work?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=92C000>
I'd say the best preparation for a career in print journalism is going to college and taking classes that require you to write a lot of papers. Periodically, you should forget about a paper until right before it's due so that you have to stay up all night typing, drinking cold coffee and wondering if you would maybe feel better if you went and threw up. If you think to yourself the next morning, "Hey, that was kind of cool," you're all set.

Are your a dog or cat person?  Or perhaps some alternative pet?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=92C000>
I like both dogs and cats. If politicians were house pets, I'd vote Independent.

"In high school I was...
<P>
<FONT COLOR=92C000>
Not paying attention. I secretly suspected that I knew more than my teachers did--except for Mr. Spaulding, who taught me that television is evil, that poetry is difficult to write and that George Washington Carver was a genius.

Describe your favorite monitor decoration/toy?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=92C000>
I guess I'd like to describe something hip and classy, like a set of miniature reproductions of the works of Marcel Duchamp, but actually all I have on my monitor is a a black corduroy baseball cap and a leaky snow globe.

The ultimate online snack is...?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=92C000>
chocolate-covered raisins. I get them at Whole Foods, so they must be good for me, right?

What applications are usually running on your computer?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=92C000>
Netscape, Microsoft Word, Eudora, Quark XPress. Also Lotus Notes, which I'm inclined to believe is the tool of the devil.

What's your favorite book? 
<P>
<FONT COLOR=92C000>
I can never seem to narrow things down to just one favorite; right now, I'm working on some Henry James.

What's your favorite cereal, and when do you indulge?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=92C000>
I like Kellogg's Corn Pops, or generic versions thereof (though I'm not sure I should admit to eating something called "Golden Corn Nuggets").

What tunes play while you surf?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=92C000>
As with most activities, surfing is better with a little Marley going in the background.
