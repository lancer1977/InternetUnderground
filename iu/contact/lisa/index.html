Are your a dog or cat person?  Or perhaps some alternative pet?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=FBFDE5>
My pet is my goldfish, Icabod, but he is not very alternative. Although we are trying to find some way of tattooing him. Those temporary tatoos tend to come off in his little fishbowl.

Describe your favorite monitor decoration/toy?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=FBFDE5>
That would have to be the polaroid transfer I got as a going away gift,
or maybe my teeney tiny pink dinosaur I stole from Bernstein. But I would like to get the Jeff Goldblum action figure from Jurassic Park. The J.G. action figure from Independence Day is inaccurate to his body proportions.This is something I willl put on my christmas list to Santa Claus this year.
