When did you join Internet Underground?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=D09820>
Sept. 5th 1995, at IU ground zero. (Oh wait - that's the wrong phrasing...ground zero is usually like the epicenter of some great catastrophe, right? Well, ah, maybe that's not so wrong after all...)

How do you spend offline time?

What was the first site that really caught your attention?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=D09820>
I really liked <A HREF="http://gertrude.art.uiuc.edu/ludgate/the/place/place2.html">The Place</A> when I saw it. I began to realize the implications of the web and how it could be used as medium for fine art.

What best prepared you for your work?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=D09820>
Coach called a double reverse pass, which takes about 27 seconds for the ball to get back to me. I'm all stretched out making the toss and this linebacker plants his helmet firmly in my chin. I get lifted off the ground from the force of the blow and hit helmet first on the turf. It took 22 stitches to close the wound.
