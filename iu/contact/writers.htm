<B>Q&GT; What is the <I>Internet Underground?</I></B>
<P>
<I>IU</I> was a magazine dedicated to covering the cool side of the Internet, with a compelling mixture of  
irreverence, humor and style. 
<p>
We are currently not in production mode, but if you would like to look into contributing, please submit something, anything, to <a href="mailto:submissions@line-in.com">IU</a>.

<!-- We seek to entertain and inform our readers and, as Kirk would say (splitting 
the infinitive), to boldly go where other Internet magazines have not gone before.

<P><HR ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=50% NOSHADE><P>

<B>Q&GT; What do you want?</B>
<P>
First, let's just say what we don't want. Poetry about the Internet (Roses are red, violets are blue, I wish 
there was a web page about you...); Celebrity for celebrity's sake (Roses are red, violets are blue, I have a 
Web page for David Duchovny); fiction; local news stories unless it can be developed into a national 
context; "newbie" stories ("How I got on the Internet"); or stories about why you think AOL sucks.
<P>
We want stories that appeal to Internet surfers who have a good sense of  humor and a liberal attitude. Our 
stories and departments must be cutting edge, so there's always one good rule of thumb: If you saw it 
written  about someplace else, especially the national mainstream media, we probably do  not want it 
unless you can put a definite "spin" on it to uncover aspects they did not.

<P><HR ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=50% NOSHADE><P>

<B>Q&GT; What kind of writers are you looking for?</B>
<P>
Our demographic covers late-teens through late 30s (and possibly upwards), educated and Internet savvy. 
So if you can write for that audience and come up with solid story ideas, we'll consider you.

<P><HR ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=50% NOSHADE><P>

<B>Q&GT; What sections are available for free-lancing?</B>
<P>
Most of the magazine lends itself to free-lancing, although the staff does much of the writing. If we find 
someone who can carry off a subject or a department well, then we'll give that writer a crack at it. 
<P>
Not open to free-lancers are Hyperlink (the letter from the editors), the Net Top Ten, Weird on the Web, Spotlight, FAQ and @large. 

<P><HR ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=50% NOSHADE><P>

<B>Q&GT; Do you ever work with unpublished writers?</B>
<P>
As a rule, we prefer to work with experienced writers. However, we will consider unpublished writers for 
department pieces on speculation. That means if we like it, then we'll pay you. If we don't, then we won't 
pay you. If you have not been published, we will judge your writing ability by the one-page query letter 
and short samples you would like us to consider. We cannot return this stuff, however.

<P><HR ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=50% NOSHADE><P>

<B>Q&GT; Which departments or regular features are open to writers?</B>
<P>
These following sections are open to free-lancers, including those with limited publishing experience. <BR>
Please send <B><I>only</I> short query letters for all of these areas</B>.
<P>
<UL>

	<LI><B>Web Pages We're Glad We Can't Find:</B> Everything seemingly has a web page these days, so this 
one-page section would essentially "create" a web page for something that is so stupid, frightening or 
arcane that it doesn't have one and frankly, we're relieved. 
	<LI><B>Flamethrower:</B> Commentary on something that seemingly goes against the sprit of the web. About 
800 words, but that can vary. Avoid censorship issues here unless you've got something new to say. 
	<LI><B>News:</B> Short news items about new services, happenings on, about or related to the Internet or the 
Web.
	<LI><B>Home page profiles:</B> Longer profiles on innovative, new Web sites that deserve an in-depth story. We 
aim to not only talk about a Web site, but also the creators behind it. Stay away from commercial sites 
and look for interesting places that can support an article of 1,000 to 2,000 words. 
	<LI><B>On the net with...</B>A two-page interview with a celebrity connected in some way with the Internet and 
doing something worthwhile.
  	<LI><B>403 Forbidden:</B> A one-page first person story about a personal topic or theme about the more "taboo" 
side of the 'net.  
	<LI><B>alt.culture.watch:</B> Short stories showing examples of references to the Internet in general media, TV, 
movies, etc. We seek humor, irony and a healthy dose of irreverence in this section (read: early Spy).
	<LI><B>Reviews.</B> We assign reviews to free-lancers routinely. If you've got experience reviewing books and a 
solid knowledge of the Net, please send in samples. 
</UL>

<B>Q&GT; What kind of feature stories are you looking for?</B>
<P>
What we don't want: How a company can market its products on the Net, "the top 50 Web sites" or scare 
stories about kids and cybersex. We like to have fun, so do our readers. We want to uncover stories and 
themes that other magazines have not or at least not covered well. We also want short, Spy magazine-like 
graphs and charts. We aren't afraid to cover anything, from cybersex to virtual voodoo. If it uncovers a 
previously unwritten or explored side the Net, then all the better.

<P> 
       Feature stories may range from 1,200 to 3,000 words; it depends on the topic and how you plan to 
cover it. We like sidebars that relate to a topic and subjects that lend themselves well to cool graphics. 
Sample subjects include how private investigators use the Internet with a sidebar on how "everyday" 
people can both protect themselves from such invasions of privacy and another sidebar on how to hack 
around to check if someone's prying into your e-mail to a story about the Web sites of obscure stars.

<P><HR ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=50% NOSHADE><P>

<B>Q&GT; How important is reporting and accuracy?</B>
<P>
Very important. We will spot check a new writer's submission. If it has mistakes, you probably won't write 
for us again. Also, as most Internet surfers know, a single missing letter can make a Web site tough to find. 
Be sure to double-check all Web addresses and facts.

<P><HR ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=50% NOSHADE><P>

<B>Q&GT; How do you want queries or copy submitted?</B>
<P>
For now, we prefer to have query letters sent via e-mail, fax or mail with previously published clips. 
Please, no phone queries -- you will lose points. Completed, assigned manuscripts should be sent via e-mail 
and backed up with a clean, easy-to-read hard copy. Be sure to include your name, address and phone 
number.

<P><HR ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=50% NOSHADE><P>

<B>Q&GT; How much do you pay and how soon?</B>
<P>
Ah, the touchy question. That varies widely. Departments run from $25 to $300. Features start at $200 and 
go up quite a bit, depending on each individual writer's experience. All fees are negotiated prior to 
assignment. We pay within about 30 days of publication, not acceptance. Stories that are turned in late are 
subject to a decrease in the negotiated payment.

<P><HR ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=50% NOSHADE><P>

<B>Q&GT; How soon will I know if you're going to assign me something?</B>
<P>
Usually within three weeks. We typically know if we're charmed or revolted by then. On some feature 
stories, if it seems like it has a shelf-life and we may consider it for the future, we will let you know that 
too.

<P><HR ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=50% NOSHADE><P>

<B>Please take note:</B> We prefer writers not submit multiple queries. This is not considered good form in 
niche publishing and it will displease the IU gods. Nor do we want you to submit reworked versions of a 
story that you wrote for another magazine or newspaper without clueing us in. Instead, send the original 
and tell us how you would write it differently for us.

<P> 

<I><B>Internet Underground</B></I> is published by Ziff-Davis Publishing Company, which also publishes Electronic Gaming
