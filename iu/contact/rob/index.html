When did you join Internet Underground?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=755099>
I was constructed for <I>Internet Underground</I>
in the year 1996. I did not join <I>IU</I> so much as I was 
forced into labor. I was programmed as the ultimate
editing machine. However a bug in my system has caused
chronic malfunctioning, thus the cause of infrequent
editorial allusions to Yanni, Kenny G. and Gallagher.

How do you spend offline time?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=755099>
Between snacks, I work as Senior Editor for IU. I do nothing else. 
<P>
Oh, maybe I do a few other things: sing Asia tunes 
at local karaoke bars, get picked on by my peers, 
watch horribly bad horror movies, write screenplay 
sequels to The Mighty Duck, jog (when my weak willed 
self allows it), eat cheap vegetarian burritos at Taco 
and Burrito House (near the corner of Broadway and 
Irving in Chicago), exercise, among other things.

What was the first site that really caught your attention?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=755099>
The Capt. Kirk Sing-A-Long page. William Shatner's

digital age had truly arrived.

Are your a dog or cat person?  Or perhaps some alternative pet?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=755099>
Dog person. Cats suck, particularly because I'm allergic to them.
Ever read 101 Uses For A Dead Cat?

Describe your favorite monitor decoration/toy?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=755099>
There's so many, where to begin?
I guess I like my little rubbery wrestler dude who enjoys
picking on the other action figures that also reside on my 
monitor.
