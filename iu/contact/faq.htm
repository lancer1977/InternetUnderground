What is <i>Internet Underground</i>?
</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial, helvetica">

<B>Originally</B>, <i>IU</i> was a print magazine published by <a href="http://www.zd.com">Ziff-Davis Publishing Co.</a>, and turned up on newsstands ten times a year. We covered the cool side of the Internet, which we admit is a rather slippery topic. We aimed to inform and entertain people who are smart, sarcastic and technologically inclined. Each content-packed issue was stylishly laid out over 82 dead-tree pages, suitable for framing.
<p>
<B>Online</B>, <i>IU</i> is still packed to the brim with fun and features. Not only does this site have stories from the print version, it also contains Internet-only content and enough site reviews to keep a small army surfing for weeks. Updates to this site will start again in the year 2001.
<p>
<B>Here's how it works:</B>
<UL>
<LI>Sneak a peek at the contents of our <a href="/iu/current/">current issue</a>, then head to your friendly neighborhood newsstand or bookstore to pick up a copy.
<P>
<LI>Browse through our <a href="/iu/archive/">archives</a>, which hold a staggering selection of the many fine features published previously in <i>IU</i>, and check out our "electric paper" for links to all the sites in a given issue (founded June 1996).
<P>
<LI>Find original content written just for this site in our <a href="/iu/online/">online only</a> section: news, reviews and the <i>IU</i> staff's weekly opinion column, <a href="/iu/online/imho/">IMHO</a>.
<P>
<LI>Explore the outer reaches of the Internet at our <a href="/iu/webguide/">WebGuide</a>, which offers point-and-click access to thousands of sites with our witty reviews and star ratings.
<P>
<LI><a href="/iu/search/">Search</a> our entire site for references to spam, speed traps or sticky wickets.
<P>
<LI>Learn the e-mail addresses and cereal preferences of the <i>IU</i> staff at our <a href="/iu/contact/">contact</a> page. We love to hear from readers--especially readers who don't make fun of our haircuts.
