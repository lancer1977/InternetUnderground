When did you join Internet Underground?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=A63530>
In August of 1995. There was no net connection in the office yet, so for a few weeks we threw a ball around the office and reminisced about being able to check our email.

How long have you been online?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=A63530>
Seven years. My friends and I used to look over people's shoulders in the dorm labs to figure out new commands.</FONT>

What do you spend most of your time doing online?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=A63530>
Blabbing in email and snooping around. When that, ahem, "important stuff" is done, I research trends and stories and technology for IU.

How do you spend offline time?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=A63530>
Editing our magazine, hiding from ringing phones, playing with my recalcitrant cat, observing things, listening to my friends' woes and writing stories.

Do you surf with links underlined?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=A63530>
No, but I do like potato chips crunched up on my ice cream.

What was the first site that really caught your attention?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=A63530>
The Squashed Bug Zoo alerted me to the fact that a disgusting topic combined with good writing and audience participation could, somehow, rock our world.<P>
But right now, I like to read Bunnyhop and The Feminist Majority.

What scares you about the Internet?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=A63530>
The net doesn't scare me. (But I have noticed that it scares many other people.)

What best prepared you for your work?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=A63530>
Writing fiction made me love words. But being a clerk in the lingerie department at Kmart taught me she works hard for the money, so hard for it honey.

Are your a dog or cat person?  Or perhaps some alternative pet?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=A63530>
"The smallest <A HREF="cat.htm">feline</A> is a masterpiece," said Da Vinci. And he would know, don't you think?

Describe your favorite monitor decoration/toy?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=A63530>
<IMG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=59 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="burro.gif" VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5 ALT="Burro">
The Burro is my favorite desk toy. He has the cutest donkey ears, and when I depress a button, the elastic strings inside his limbs go slack and he collapses. Then I can make him snap smartly to attention again. I use The Burro as a puppet expressing my secret desires. "Hey! The Burro says to stop throwing that ball around!"

What applications are usually running on your computer?
<P>

Word, Eudora, Quark, Netscape, and Hyperterminal... and sometimes sound files of Ralph "I bent my wookiee" Wiggum.

What's your favorite book? 
<P>
<FONT COLOR=A63530>
Umm, it's way too hard to name just one. But my ideal bookshelf would hold Gabriel Garcia Marquez's <I>Love in the Time of Cholera,</I> C.S. Lewis' books on Narnia, <I>The Feminist Dictionary,</I> Douglas Coupland's <I>microserfs,</I> anything by John Irving, <I>The Giving Tree,</I> and a thesaurus.

What's your favorite cereal, and when do you indulge?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=A63530>
Fruity Pebbles, but I can't bring myself to buy them. They're sinfully candyish.

What tunes play while you surf?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=A63530>
Liz Phair kicks everybody's ass. But Sugar, The Jayhawks, Carly Simon, The Rentals, Poi Dog Pondering, Prince, Cocteau Twins, Talking Heads, Manhattan Transfer, Portishead, and Randy Newman all have a special place... scattered on my bedroom floor. And WXRT's benefit CDs for women's shelters are amazing albums for an important cause. <P>
And just in case you were wondering, you basically can't go wrong in life giving your money to good music and good causes. <P>
