Subscribers and potential subscribers, thank you for your patience. As you may or may 
not know, <I>Internet Underground</I> was bought by Ziff-Davis in early May. While the 
editorial vision of the magazine has not been altered one iota, as with any take-over the 
business aspects of the magazine have been re-evaluated. Hopefully this FAQ will clear 
up any subscription questions you may have. 
<P>

What's up? I called the 1-800 # and it sounds like you guys are out of business?
</B>
<P>
Nothing could be further from the truth. We're still chained to our desks cranking out 
quality editorial. As you know from reading <I>IU</I>, we already like to challenge you, our 
readers, intellectually, so we figured why not challenge you physically by making you 
schlep to the newsstand to pick up your monthly copy.
<P>
<BR>

<B>
Wait a second, you took my money, why haven't I gotten my magazine?
</B>
<P>
That's the bad news. As of the August issue of <I>IU</I> (#9) subscriptions to <I>IU</I> have been 
suspended. That means your August issue will never arrive in your mailbox. Leave the 
house now to go snatch a copy off the newsstand before they're sold out. If you're having 
trouble finding the magazine in your area, bug your local retailers to start carrying it. 
<P>
<BR>
<BR> 
<B>
Then what's going to happen to my subscription?
</B>
<P>
As of mid-August you should have received a letter from us explaining the situation. 
Basically, the balance of your subscription is being transferred to <I>Electronic Gaming 
Monthly</I> (EGM), an excellent magazine covering the exciting world of 
Nintendo, Sega, Sony Playstation and other video games. 
<P>
<BR>
<BR> 
<B>
Video games? I don't play video games! Can I get my MONEY back?
</B>
<P>
Yes, you can. In order to receive a refund for the balance of your subscription please send 
an e-mail message to <A HREF="mailto:rdaros@zd.com">rdaros@zd.com</A> with the subject line "<I>IU</I> Refund Request." Your 
request must include the full name and address you used to subscribe to <I>IU</I>. Even if you 
opt for a refund we will send you <I>EGM</I> for the balance of your subscription at no cost.
<P>
<BR>
<BR> 
<B>
Listen, I really don't need <I>EGM</I>, is there any way to get you not to send it?
</B>
<P>
Of course, just note in your refund request that you don't even want the free subscription 
to EGM. You may get an issue or two before your cancellation is processed. Heck, you 
might even like it. 
<P>
<BR>
<BR> 
<B>
I still have more questions, who will answer them?
</B>
<P>
Direct any further questions you have to have <A HREF="mailto:IU@mcs.com">IU@mcs.com</A>
