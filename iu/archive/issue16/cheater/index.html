<P>
Was it unjust and inhumane? What happened to the Cherokee during that long and 
treacherous journey? They were brave and...
<P>
[<I>Editor's note: </I> Wait a second. What does it have to do with the Internet? 
This sounds more like the beginning of a bad high school history paper.]
<P>
[Author's note: </I> Right. Umm, OK. Sorry. Here goes again.]
<P>
I understand that some students that have already graduated from college are 
having a bit of trouble getting their new businesses started. I know of a tool that 
will be extremely helpful and is already available to them: the Internet.
<P>
[Editor's note: </I> Stop right there! I wrote that intro on a paper back in college. 
I remember because I stayed up all night drinking Jolt Cola, listening to Anthrax 
and pricking myself with pins.]
<P>
[Author's note: </I> That explains the punctuation errors.]
<P>
[Editor's note: </I> Listen, wise guy, I got a B+ on that masterpiece. Where did 
you get that intro from, anyway?]
<P>
[Author's note: </I> I downloaded the Trail of Tears paragraph from the School 
Sucks Web site and the Internet one from the Evil House of Cheat, just two of the 
many Web sites that have copies of recycled research papers. You want something 
else? Maybe a biology report on Huntington's Disease? A creative-writing story 
about renovating a palazzo? A law study of <I>Marbury vs. Madison? </I>]
<P>
[Editor's note: </I> Look, just write the story you were assigned to do--in your 
own words.]

Kenny Sahr gets an A+ for rationalization. He says his Web page--
www.schoolsucks.com, one of many term-paper-trading resources on the Internet--
isn't simply a seedy den for student cheaters. It's a detailed critique of the world's 
school systems. The term papers he posts, which many students simply download 
and turn in, aren't the problem. They're a symptom.
<P>
"This site is not about plagiarism," says Sahr, a fast-talking 25-year-old who has 
been running School Sucks for more than a year. "One of the arguments I get from 
professors is 'These papers suck.' My attitude is, these papers are reflective of the 
students of the world. How dare (professors) say that? I absolutely reject that. Any 
professor who thinks the papers suck should go learn how 
to teach."
<P>
See the logic? The papers are horribly written, and yet students can turn them 
in and, occasionally, get good grades. Therefore, it's the school system's fault. Sahr 
continues to rant: The tenure system encourages lazy teachers; communications 
classes are archaic; professors without even a minor in education are bad for 
colleges; athletes zip by in easy classes while professors look the other way. "There 
is something really wrong going on here," he says. "This education system is 
a farce."
<P>
Because School Sucks has a catchy name and a controversial reputation, Sahr has 
been rewarded with a media pulpit from which he can spread his views. Since last 
June, the Miami resident and former Israeli soldier says he has done over 300 
interviews for stories in publications such as the <I>Washington Post Online</I>, 
<I>Newsweek Online</I>, the <I>Detroit News</I> and <I>Peopl</I>e. His 
overriding purpose, he says, is not to profit from the black-market term-paper 
trade. It's to draw attention to his arguments about the educational system.
<P>
Presented with Sahr's line of reasoning, Northwestern University computer 
science professor Joseph Walther pauses briefly, before erupting in loud, sincere 
laughter for several seconds. "I don't think we have a mediocre educational system 
at the institution of my current employ," he says.
<P>
"I've looked at one of those (term paper) sites," Walther says. "It worried me 
when I first heard about it and then I looked at the quality of the papers there and 
I'm not worried anymore. Anyone who turns in a paper like that would not pass 
my class."
<P>
<BR>
Most students are inclined not to cheat, says Donald G. Marshall, head of the 
English department at the University of Illinois-Chicago. (Notably, UIC was 
recently listed along with Harvard University and the University of Texas on 
School Sucks' list of "Slacker Schools of the Week." This is apparently based on 
Sahr's informal poll of his site's paper traders.) "This is sort of 'Dog bites man'--the 
real story is that the millions of students who could cheat don't," Marshall says. "A 
tiny fraction cheat. People love to exaggerate things, but most people 
are honest.
<P>
"I understand, being a human being, substituting the wrong goal for the real 
goal. There's always somebody in society who's exploiting people's weaknesses and 
trying to make money out of it. That's something they do cold-bloodedly in their 
own interests. It's kind of a cynical exploitation of a student's weaknesses. That's 
really reprehensible. That's really evil."
<P>
For as long as there have been colleges, there have been services for lazy or 
struggling students to buy pre-written term papers. If professors had the power to 
do anything about them, those long-running "TERM PAPER BLUES?" ads at the 
back of Rolling Stone would have disappeared long ago. But the Internet has made 
shady transactions so much easier. Plug "term papers" into Yahoo! and more than a 
dozen working Web addresses for paper-trading sites come up.
<P>
It's hard to tell, on the surface, which of these sites profit from students' cheat 
money and which simply help frustrated paper-writers come up with ideas and 
hard-to-find documents. Almost every site contains a disclaimer: "For research or 
informational purposes only." Technically, this means you can't turn in a paper for 
class credit. In practice, on the Internet, the agreement carries as much weight as 
"Stop! You must be 18 or older to proceed."
<P>
<BR>
There are for-profit sites, such as the <A HREF="http://www.termpaperware
house.com/tpw/">Term Paper Warehouse</A>, which charges $6.50 a page for prewritten papers on "How to 
Change Your Oil" or "The Declining Power of Europe." There are free sites with a 
hidden agenda, like Sahr's. And there are free sites run by actual 
students, including the pseudonymous 17-year-old San Jose, Calif., resident "Steve 
Case," who started <A HREF="http://www.mbay.net/~td3512/">his page</A> with friends' term-paper 
donations. "It is a free country," he says. "People can do what they like with them."
<P>
School Sucks, thanks to Sahr's uncanny ability to promote himself through the 
national media, is the most prominent "cheating" site. "I answer every e-mail I get 
from professors--well over 500. I'm probably misnumbering it by thousands," Sahr 
says. "A lot of times they call up yelling and screaming...I explain to them the 
reasons for this site and they understand.
<P>
"The letters we get from the students are gems. They're so funny. First of all, 
they think we'll send anything to them. We'll get 10 messages a day saying 'I need a 
paper on...' All these Beavises and Butt-heads out there saying, 'Anything on math. 
Please! I can't do math!' You can almost see the desperation."
<P>
Sahr, who also hawks a rock tape-trading network and his Israeli travel book on 
the page, hopes to incorporate his musings about School Sucks into a second book. 
But recently his competitors have started to pay attention to his self-promotional 
reputation: "Schoolsucks.com sucks up to the media so much...it just bugs me," says 
Jonathan Bagot, an 18-year-old college student who runs the year-old <A HREF="http://cygnus.rsabbs.com/~jbagot/">Term Paper 
Emporium</A>. And Peter Revson, managing research 
consultant of the more reputable <A HREF="http://www.execpc.com/~hppapers">High Performance Papers</A>, says Sahr's true purpose is to just "elicit ads."
<P>
<BR>

Revson's six-year-old company, owned by two attorneys and based just south of 
Milwaukee, is in a tricky position. High Performance Papers makes decent money--
of the Web page's 600 hits a day, Revson says, 60 become paid orders--providing 
what the company terms "Professionally Prepared Research Documents." He says 
his clients are professionals who can't write; foreign students who need help finding 
English-language research; and rural residents whose local libraries have sparse 
resources. Almost nobody, he says, has ever tried to buy one of the company's 
documents and turn it in for class credit.
<P>
Yet High Performance Papers still fights the negative perception created 
by School Sucks or the Evil House of Cheat. Revson says such sites "give the 
industry a bad name."
<P>
Revson has talked a few times with Jens Schriver, a 19-year-old Copenhagen, 
Denmark, student who has been running the <A HREF="http://www.CheatHouse.com">Evil House of Cheat</A> for more than two years. He says he can't fault Schriver 
for wanting to make a few bucks. (For the record, Schriver defends his site's holy 
purposes, too: "It's a library. A research center. In that light, it is something very 
positive.")
<P>
But Revson says the title "Evil House of Cheat"--not to mention a huge ad 
banner for a phone-sex page, displayed prominently at the top of the site--doesn't 
exactly help the site's image as a research foundation. Schriver says he would never 
consider changing the site's name. "Who would be interested?" he asks. "It's an eye-
catcher. If it wasn't a bit provocative, it would just seem boring."
<P>
In the end, Schriver admits, money is "the main reason it is still up. I wouldn't do 
it if I lost money on it."

Though Revson says some states have laws preventing second-hand term paper 
distribution, there's certainly nothing illegal about them on the Internet. Still, many 
fed-up advocates of honest education--not to mention people out to make a few 
bucks--have been trying to steer desperate students from cheating pages to more 
positive study pages. Infonautics, the Wayne, Pa., company best known for its 
<A HREF="http://www.elibrary.com">Electric Library media database</A>, even took the unusual step of 
advertising its <A HREF="http://www. researchpaper.com">homework-helper page</A> on School Sucks.
<P>
Researchpaper.com is "Gallant" to School Sucks' "Goofus." Its search engines 
scour dozens of the Electric Library's newspapers and magazines, including 
<I>Newsday</I> and the <I>Los Angeles Times</I>, for matching articles. 
There's a chat room, a writing center with tips on grammar and conciseness, and a 
directory of topic ideas. So it's not surprising that Tom Damico, the company's 
business development manager, says he's "100 percent against" School Sucks and its 
founder's values.
<P>
"Does our ad on Schoolsucks.com give it credibility and make it legit?" Damico 
asks. "I really don't think it does. Our ad is such dirt-cheap advertising, it's not 
going to make it worthwhile for anybody. We think [School Sucks] is definitely 
getting a lot of eyeballs by students interested in the concept," Damico says. "But 
I'm guessing that the great majority of students would never cheat or take 
advantage of these sites...The fact remains: You've got to write a research paper. 
Why don't you come to our site? It's really letting people take advantage of the 
Internet."

In conclusion, then, the Cherokee survived the hardships of the Trail of Tears and 
the loss of their loved ones and all that belonged to them. Their population 
continues to grow inspite of the immense...
<P>
[<I>Editor's note:</I> Hold it, hold it. "Inspite of?" And what's with the Cherokees again?]
<P>
[<I>Author's note:</I> I couldn't think of an ending, so I took a quick spin back to School 
Sucks. Much easier that way! It was either the Cherokees or that palazzo 
renovation. What is a palazzo anyway?]
<P>
[<I>Editor's note:</I> Listen, I'm sick of this. Just end this story in your own words or I'll 
download your paycheck from the School Sucks page.]
<P>
Sahr, who with a partner runs an Internet content marketing company called 
Moonstone, is frank about his secondary motives. Yes, he says, he would like to 
make money off School Sucks. And while his growing media profile hasn't set off 
an avalanche of new business, it hasn't hurt business either. But money isn't the 
bottom line, Sahr says: "My concerns are the concerns of my students. Just by 
having the papers out there, it's keeping the professors on their toes."
<P>
Responds Marshall, the UIC's English department head: "The odor of 
rationalization is just all over that."
