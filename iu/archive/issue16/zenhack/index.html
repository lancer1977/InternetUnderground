Don't call them hackers, call them <I>Homo sapiens hackii</I>--
human beings who are "back-engineered" by their symbiotic relationship 
with computer networks to frame reality in ways shaped by that 
interaction. They're not a new species, but they're a new variety, and 
just like the pod people in <I>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</I>, 
they're everywhere. But how can separate the real thing from the 
pretenders? 
<P>
Looks, jargon and hard-guy handles are too easy to imitate. Besides, 
real hackers blend in well with their surroundings--that's the point of 
social engineering, after all--and hide in large corporations, high-tech 
start-ups and IT departments, and in intelligence, security and law 
enforcement.  
<P>
Some don't even use computers very much.	
<P>
"I couldn't hack my way out of a wet paper bag," confesses William 
Knowles, who hangs out on a hacker listserv. "But information hacking, 
social engineering, dumpster diving, yes--and I'm a terror on the 
telephone. I am the gatekeeper's worst nightmare!"
<P>
"It comes down to a common quest for knowledge," Knowles says. 
"Why does it do what it does? Who,    what, where, when, why, how?"
<P>
Hackers are distinguished by their hunger for knowledge. They long to 
see things whole and yearn to know how things work. Their power 
derives from the critical knowledge that leverages other knowledge, their 
enthusiasm from an adrenaline rush that comes when they finally make 
that connection, solve that puzzle. 	
<P>
When the door against which you've been banging your head 
suddenly dissolves and you slip effortlessly to the next level--that's the 
joy of hacking. But the game isn't Doom or Quake, the game is life, and 
the playing field is the infinity of the wired world that your mind explores 
in the night like a stealth fighter. 
<P>
Some hackers have been wired since early childhood; they see the 
world in the image of networks. 
<P>
When you learn as a child how to creep unnoticed into root under 
cover of darkness, or hide in a sniffer that's a surrogate self so you can 
steal the secrets of the rich and powerful or observe the hidden life of 
corporations and governments, learn how it really is behind the fictions 
by which men live, then steal away at dawn leaving not so much as a 
single track in the melting snows of cyberspace--then you know what 
hacking means. 
<P>
Hackers are men and women who go where they must go to learn 
what they must learn. 
<P>
Often portrayed as rebellious heretics, hackers are in fact faithful 
followers of three gods: 
<UL>
<LI>Odin, who hung cold and alone in a windswept tree for nine long 
days and nights, sleepless and single-hearted, in order to seize the 
knowledge of the Runes. The Runes were symbols of what the Greeks 
called <I>logos</I>, the creative power of the Word, the magic of 
consciousness acting on inanimate matter and making it plastic. 	
<P>
<LI>The trickster Coyote, who some call Pan, his wry humor a grin in the 
shadows, his appetites and passions a firestorm of Dionysian ardor. 
<P>
<LI>Jesus the man, the earthy Jew, a real mensch rather than a dreamy-
eyed Nordic nanny-of-the-planet, who refused to knuckle under to 
convention or the suffocating constraints of the lowest common 
denominator of the crowd.
</UL>
<BR>

<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighten Up</B>
<P>
Hackers have a sense of humor. 	
<P>
Dr. Bergan Evans, an English professor at Northwestern University, 
spoke with a chuckle in the early '60s of a social worker's excessive 
worry about "juvenile delinquents" stealing cars. He recalled how he and 
his boyhood chums stole away in the night to loose the horses from a 
neighbor's corral.
<P>
"It wasn't called delinquency in my day," he said. "It was called 'boys 
will be boys.'"
<P>
We discover in the process of living life with gusto the boundaries we 
had better not cross, then learn how to set limits from within. The risks 
must be real or the rewards aren't real. 
<P>
"The callbacks started to terrify me," admits Attitude Adjuster of his 
early days of phreaking. "I have a healthy fear of being busted. 
Thankfully, I didn't get busted, and I came out the better for it."
<P>
So let's lighten up. Hackers are not just whacked-out loners in 
darkened bedrooms, cackling like Beavis and Butt-head as they break 
into your bank account. Hackers at their best are trekkers who hike the 
peaks and valleys of the virtual world. The infrastructure of the world is 
a puzzle invented to test their mettle. They fail into failure again and 
again before failing into success: The non-pattern of chaotic data 
suddenly coalesces, the dots connect and anxiety vanishes. 
<P>
You see how it works! Bingo! You understand how it all hangs 
together.
<P>
This is not the malevolent caricature invented by the media to feed 
the fearful projections of those who don't know. This is humanity at its 
best. 
<P>
So if my description evokes judgment, a desire to chastise these high 
spirits like a stern schoolmaster, beat down that restless intelligence 
and control them, get them back into the box--then quit reading right 
now and turn the page. 
<P>
But if you know what I'm talking about--if you have ever bent your 
back too long under a low ceiling defined by the rigidly righteous and 
finally had to stand up, your head crashing through plaster into thin air--
then read on. This is a partial glimpse through the eyes of some of the 
best and the brightest of the promise and possibilities of the wired 
world. 
<P>
<BR>

<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Living by a Vision</B>
<P>
Technically, it's called "living proleptically"--when a new possibility 
breaks into the present with such compelling power that we have no 
choice but to live out of that vision as if it's real. We adopt a new point 
of reference, and by living as if it has already happened, we make it 
real. 
<P>
Hang out with hackers and you'll find yourself moving toward their way 
of framing reality. That's how we know that the <I>tao</I>--the way 
things are flowing--is moving in that direction. 
<P>
Example: A teacher I know was supposed to teach her fourth graders 
how to use computers but she didn't know how. She made a secret 
pact with her three brightest students to meet her after school to teach 
her computing so she could teach the other students computing.
<P>
Of course many hackers are bored with school! They haven't the 
patience to wait while the teachers catch up. They don't want 
information delivered at the plodding pace of a curriculum through a 
command-and-control structure. They want to get out there on the 
wires and get it themselves.
<P>
"The administrator that I work for at school," says Attitude Adjuster, 
"lets me hack the system all I want. He doesn't interfere because he 
doesn't know what I'm doing. Sometimes he asks me, 'What should I do 
next?' I can't believe what I'm hearing. I want to say, 'You mean you 
haven't figured that out yet from the logical progression of things?' I 
used to try to tell him what to do next and he would ask, 'Why?' I 
stopped answering because any answer I gave him, he couldn't 
understand. He could never see the Big Picture so the details never 
connected in a way that made sense."
<P>
Se7en, a noted hacker, says, "There were a lot of great discoveries 
through the years, but the greatest was how I grew in knowledge in my 
own eyes. The giant telephone company and many of the all-knowing 
corporations really had very little clue as to what they were doing. The 
all-powerful government--starting wars, controlling your life--did not 
have a clue as to what a computer is or what it can do."
<P>
A hacker and phreaker from the age of 11, Se7en recently came up 
from the underground, looking for a little light and air. He now lectures 
engineers in the intelligence community on the psychology of hacking--
how to tell from the tracks if an intruder is a 
trophy-hunting kid or an intelligence agent looking for proprietary data.
<P>
"The realization that all of these people that as a kid you're told to 
respect and fear--in a lot of ways you're a lot smarter than many of 
these people...You find out there's nothing special about these people. 
Here you are, some little 15- or 16-year old kid, you can do things that 
the phone company can't even do or the government can't even do."
<P>
<BR>

<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Living As If the New 
World is Already Here </B>
<P>
For some, that vision begins with a blinding light; for others it just 
happens to happen.	
<P>
"My first computer was a Commodore 64," says DIALTONE_, who 
works for a high-tech Canadian company. "I started with games, but 
they bored me, so I started looking into the works of the computer. It 
fascinated the hell out of me!" After getting his first modem and being 
turned on to hacking by the sysop of a BBS, he hacked into his first 
computer.
<P>
"As I was exploring. I had this feeling of...it was a feeling you can't 
explain, anxiety to get ahold and see everything I could. Sure, I was 
scared at first, but that disappeared as I 
discovered what was in this machine."  
<P>
Modify remembers it similarly.
<P>
"My first real hack was into the system of a nuclear engineering 
company. I took the unshadowed password file, then went back to take 
a look at the system itself...Wow, was it great! You're torn between two 
emotions. One is, what if I screw up and leave my muddy footprints all 
over the computer? The other is, what does this thing do? What 
information does it hold? You are 'God' over that machine."
<P>
For Attitude Adjuster, his interest developed more gradually through 
conversations with kindred spirits.
<P>
"More than anything else, it was something I talked about with other 
kids who used public computers in the library. We'd sit around and 
speculate about other systems, huddle around the single Unix reference 
the library owned."
<P><BR>

<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Machinery 
is Always On</B> 
<P>
Hackers are need-to-know machines, obsessively searching for a way 
to scratch that itch and gain momentary peace before it flares 
up again. 
<P>
The popular perception of hackers as malicious warez kiddies 
downloading someone else's code draws contempt from hackers who 
earn their knowledge with sleepless nights and relentless exploration. 
<P>
Use someone else's scripts to do something malicious or damage 
someone's system?
<P>
"That's not hacking," says Yobie Benjamin, a respected emerging 
technologies consultant. Benjamin has worked with Netscape, Sun 
Microsystems, Boeing, Hewlett Packard and many others on 
prototyping, project development and product design. He knows that 
many respectable names in high-tech commerce earned their stripes as 
hackers.
<P>
"Sure, we all did some of that when we were kids first starting out. 
Maybe that's all you know how to do when you begin. But what moves 
me is, what's out there? Hacking for me is more than a quest, it's the 
quest--the quest for knowledge."    
<P>
Listen to Modify: "When I went on to learn advanced programming 
languages, I would sit in a bookstore until closing time and just read up 
on all types of stuff--circuits, DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls, Unix, Java--I have 
tons of books all over the house and that's pretty much how I got into 
hacking, feeding my head with knowledge from books and classes in 
schools."
<P>
Dark Tangent, the highly respected founder of DefCon, the annual 
summer convention for computer hackers, security specialists, 
intelligence personnel, journalists and IT professionals, reflects on what 
distinguishes the best hackers. "The defining characteristic is they see 
the Big Picture," he says. "They have incredible amounts of knowledge 
and have gone into things at incredibly deep levels. There is such an 
immense base of knowledge about competing technologies, so if you 
can see the Big Picture...there's often a defining moment when you see 
the whole thing come together. 
<P>
"Everyone specializes so much," Dark Tangent continues, "that it's 
important to know people in all the different areas. You have to know 
what you don't need to know and you have to know who you can call 
when you need to know it."
<P>
That doesn't sound like a loner who can't talk face-to-face with 
another human being, does it? 
<P>
"You need to surround yourself with intelligent people," Dark Tangent 
adds. "You don't need to be a social genius, but it's a lot more fun if you 
are. You can make it just trading tokens of knowledge, the currency of 
hacking and advance through 'remote learning.' But the Network is not 
just computers, it's knowledgeable people connected by computers." 
<P><BR>

<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do the Homework</B>
<P>
Hackers have little patience with people who want to be spoon-fed 
hard-earned knowledge and won't do the homework. A sure way to 
invite flames is to ask on a listserv, "Can someone please tell me how 
to hack Windows NT?"
<P>	
Most "hacking sites" are dismissed as lists of links to other links, 
although, according to Se7en, "There are some good things out there--
but you have to know where to look." 
<P>
Se7en, like most of the hackers I spoke with, connected with a 
mentor at a critical moment in his career. That mentor taught him how 
to look through trash for hours to find the few significant items that 
would let him gain entry to the telephone system; more importantly, his 
mentor taught him by example how to mentor.
<P>
"I tell people to learn the way I learn," Se7en says. "Read, read, read, 
learn, learn, learn. Do everything you can to answer your own questions 
first. Get good books on Unix or Windows NT security or TCP/IP, then 
come to me with the questions you can't answer."
<P>
By being available to provide information at the right moment to 
enable a learner to leverage what he already knows, Se7en defines the 
ideal coach. 
<P>
"That's why I surround myself with intelligent people," Dark Tangent 
says. "My friends all know things I don't. I never answer e-mail that says 
'teach me, teach me.' The knowledge is out there for anyone who is 
committed. Give the word 'hack' to a search engine and start plowing 
through the thousands of hits you get."
<P>
Modify remembers staying up all night coding text games and 
debugging others' programs, learning by doing. One of his early 
connections was Ruff-Neck, who told him, "Learn as much as you can 
and don't think of problems as problems. Think of them more as 
challenges." 
<P>
DIALTONE_ adds, "I'm not unwilling to help others, but I'm not going 
to teach a kid to hack. There's no future in it and often someone who is 
just starting is focused entirely on 
'illegal hacking' and will end up getting busted."
<P>
He gives the example of a student at the high school where he works. 
Lots of people want to "run the Network," he says, but "she's the only 
one willing to do what it takes to learn about it. She started asking 
specific, pointed questions about networking. That earned her my 
undivided attention and assistance in learning."
<P>
A hacker named Artimage says, "Many people complain that older 
hackers won't teach them anything or answer questions. First, these 
people taught themselves, no one gave them the information. Second, 
if you have researched your question to the best of your abilities 
beforehand, and it is a specific question, it will most often be answered. 
"Hackers teach themselves. That's the whole point...If you want to 
crack into systems, you can have someone show you how, but to be a 
hacker means that you explore the system on your own..."
<P>
And finally, listen to Rogue Agent set someone straight on a listserv. 
"You want to create hackers? Don't tell them how to do this or that. 
Show them how to discover it for themselves. Those who have the 
innate drive will get the point and find tutorials written by experts or dive 
in and learn by trial and error. Those who don't will fall by the wayside, 
staying comfortable within the bounds of their safe little lives."
<P><BR>

<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Journey
Becomes a Quest</B>
<P>
With power comes responsibility. 
<P>
I was talking with Dead Addict about the adrenaline rush that comes 
when you discover valuable information and are tempted to use it. 
"That's the trouble with being God," he said. "You can look but you can't 
touch." 
<P>
Maybe that's what Dark Tangent means when he speaks of keeping 
your balance and "managing your ego," which he does by hanging out 
with smart friends. That keeps the 
limits of his own knowledge in 
perspective. 
<P>
Perspective is needed as you move down the hacker's path. You 
discover that the fact of hacking makes a commitment for you to pierce 
the veil of illusion and discover the truth. That can be lonely. It gets cold 
out there, hanging night after night in a windswept tree.
<P>
"Your perspective changes as a result of learning how things really 
work," Dark Tangent observes. "I have had to recognize that my 
perception of reality is fundamentally different than that of people who 
don't want to know how it really is. You can come off sounding cynical, 
but it isn't cynicism, really, it's just that you have had experiences they 
haven't and that deeper reality becomes your point of departure and 
your point of reference."
<P>
That's why hackers necessarily build a community founded on 
camaraderie, mutual respect, and enough trust to get the job done 
balanced by a healthy dose of paranoia. That community is regulated by 
an informal system of norms and shared values, a code derived from 
experience. Like all codes, the Hackers' Code is a plumb line enabling 
hackers to "true themselves up" when they get off track.  
<P>
"The ethic is there--it really is," insists Attitude Adjuster. "There will 
always be malicious kids who don't understand, and maybe all of us 
were there at one time, but evolution will single them out. They'll either 
get busted or close enough to being busted (like I was) to get scared 
back onto the right path."
<P>
DIALTONE_ and his cohorts in =x9= drew up a code of ethics that 
reveals why the world of hacking can look so different inside than from 
outside. The Code is proscriptive (don't do it) about intentional damage 
to others' systems but pragmatic as to how to protect yourself when 
crossing the 
borders that must be crossed to hack in the first place.
<P>
The contextual shift through which our culture is moving is immense. 
Hackers live in the gray areas that must exist as we redefine ourselves. 
Many began hacking when there was nothing illegal about cracking 
games, copying an article or singing camp songs without a permit. 
Intellectual property rights? International traffic in digital goods? The 
ownership of a link? 
<P>
"How clearly are these boundaries defined?" laughs Tim Muth, an 
attorney who specializes in cyberlaw. "Come back in five years when 
we've had some cases. I'll tell you then."
<P><BR>

<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Spirit of Hacking</B>
<P>
Hackers refuse to be defined by conventional wisdom, conventional 
behavior. In the '60s the hackers at MIT became known for a spirit of 
exploration as the virtual world became an emergent reality on 
mainframes. Then the media skewed the image of hackers toward the 
criminal misfit and forced the distinction between hackers and crackers, 
those who use hacking skills to cause damage or steal secrets. Hackers 
are fighting a battle they may have already lost to save their name. 
<P>
If the best hackers are not hanging porno on government Web sites, 
what are they doing? Where is the "redeeming social value" in all this?
<P>
First, many who make their living in computer security, military and 
civilian intelligence and law enforcement learned their craft as hackers 
or hire hackers. 
<P>
Secondly, hackers provide value for the computer industry by 
identifying bugs and security holes. Many software companies count on 
hackers to work free to locate holes in their applications. What else is a 
beta version? Why else do manufacturers of firewalls offer cash to 
penetrate their systems?
<P>
Yobie Benjamin, working with cohorts from the l0pht and the DoC 
group, discovered several serious holes in Windows NT 4.0, not the 
least of which was the ability to steal passwords in an entire NT domain 
and capture all the traffic in an NT Network.
<P>
Unlike criminals intent on exploiting these flaws, their exploits were 
shared with Microsoft and the public. 
<P>
"The only thing the public knows about hackers is how they defaced 
some Web page or crashed a server," Modify says. "They never hear 
about the hacker that e-mails an administrator about the holes in his 
security or fixes security breaches for a system administrator."
<P>
Third, hackers engage in wide-ranging projects that have great 
promise for future applications. Benjamin identifies the essence of 
hacking as trailblazing.
 <P>
"Take the challenge of parallel processing," he says. "Every day, there 
are thousands of computers sitting idle while projects that could use 
their power or schools that don't have access to networks sit idly by. 
We're exploring ways to link those computers, align that processor 
power for parallel processing." 
<P>
Benjamin is also fascinated by applying the command-and-control 
model to the current multiplicity of digital interfaces to assist the 
convergence of electronic appliances and software applications into a 
single networked entity.
<P>
"I took apart one of my remotes, rewired it and plugged it into a 
parallel port so I could program my VCR over the Internet.
<P>
"Now, why," he continues, "shouldn't all of the arbitrary devices that 
constitute digital interfaces be linked in the same way? Why not develop 
an application for power companies, for example, as they bundle 
products in a deregulated environment?"
<P>
Benjamin is committed to developing applications that empower 
people to build their own virtual spaces, enabling them to interoperate 
and intercommunicate through an infrastructure that already exists. 
Benjamin's vision is a world of consumers able to control their own 
futures in cyberspace. 
<P>
The Hacker's Code is an affirmation of life itself, life that wants to 
know, and grow, and extend itself. 
<P>
Hackers are threatening because they live like spies, appearing to 
play by the rules but given secret sanction to break them. Sanction 
comes not from a central government, however, but from the facts of 
paradigm change, hierarchical restructuring and exponential change 
itself. The evolution of a single global economy mandates that every 
business behave as if it's an independent country. Every enterprise must 
manage its proprietary data and master the craft of intelligence and 
disinformation. Information is currency, and those who know how to get 
it and integrate it into meaningful patterns are the new Masters of 
the Universe. 
<P>
The skills of hackers--a love of adventure and risk, a toleration of 
ambiguity, an ability to synthesize meaning from disparate sources, a 
commitment to knowledge--are skills needed in the next century. 
Hackers are the pathfinders of the wilderness called the future toward 
which the <I>tao</I> is flowing like a river, flowing and branching 
fractal-like, flowing in the vanishing tracks of hackers.
