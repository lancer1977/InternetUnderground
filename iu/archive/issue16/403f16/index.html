Cybersitter's Unspectacular Ethics
</B></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial, genava">

Solid Oak Software, a California company, recently added my Webzine, The 
<I>Ethical Spectacle</I>, <A HREF="http://www.spectacle.org">www.spectacle.org</A>, to the list of sites blocked by its Cybersitter software. 
Solid Oak markets Cybersitter as a shield against pornography, hate speech and 
criminal activity on the Net, but the <I>Spectacle</I> is a monthly collection of 
thought pieces concentrating on the intersection (or collision) of ethics, law and 
politics in our society. The whole experience illustrates very nicely how blocking 
software, touted by some as a reasonable alternative to government intervention, 
can profoundly harm our freedom of speech.
<P>
Last summer, Solid Oak threatened two well-respected Net journalists, Declan 
McCullagh and Brock Meeks, with prosecution for writing a piece about the 
company's expansive and surprising blocking practices. Soon after, Bennett 
Haselton, a student at Vanderbilt and founder of Peacefire, an anti-censorship 
organization for young people (<A HREF="http://www.peacefire.org">www.peacefire.org</A>), wrote an essay pointing out 
that Cybersitter blocked sites like the National Organization for Women 
(<A HREF="http://www.now.org">www.now.org</A>) and <I>Mother Jones</I> magazine (<A HREF="http://www.mojo.com">www.mojo.com</A>). Solid 
Oak's president, Brian Milburn, responded by blocking Haselton's Web pages and 
calling him an "aspiring felon." I wrote to Milburn, objecting to his bullying 
behavior. Next, I added a "Don't Buy Cybersitter" button to the <I>Spectacle</I> 
top page, linked to a copy of Haselton's essay, with some added thoughts of my 
own and links to other pages blocked by Cybersitter. Solid Oak blocked the 
<I>Spectacle</I> a few weeks later.
<P>
I wrote to Milburn requesting an explanation and received a response: "Do not 
contact this company again." I learned from Haselton that Solid Oak had created 
an e-mail alias, <I>blocking.problems@solidoak.com</I>, supposedly to act as an arbiter 
when people object to the blocking of sites, so I copied my correspondence to this 
alias. Here is the answer I received: "Your 'appeal' is noted. DO NOT SEND E-
MAIL TO THIS DOMAIN AGAIN." 
<P>
In the weeks that have elapsed since then, scores of other people from around 
the world have been kind enough to write to Solid Oak, protesting the blocking of 
Peacefire and <I>The Ethical Spectacle</I>. Milburn and Solid Oak's marketing 
exec, Marc Kanter, have spoken to the press, calling me variously a "publicity 
seeker" and the dupe of a "right-wing agenda," among other things. Milburn's 
favorite explanation is that I link from my pages to other blocked sites, such as 
Peacefire. This is particularly strange reasoning; if Cybersitter now blocks everyone 
who links to <I>The Ethical Spectacle</I>, Peacefire, NOW or any other banned 
site, sooner or later Solid Oak will block the entire Internet. 
<P>
Cybersitter blocks the whole spectacle.org domain, including every one of the 26 
monthly issues published so far. The most influential issue of the 
<I>Spectacle</I> was the June 1995 <A 
HREF="http://www.spectacle.org/695/ausch.html">"An Auschwitz 
Alphabet"</A>. This compilation of Holocaust materials and essays about them 
has resulted in hundreds of favorable letters from teachers, schoolchildren and 
college students around the world. 
<P>
I collected about 10 of these responses and sent them to Brian Milburn in a 
letter in which I also asked him:<BR>
"1. Why do you think your dislike of criticism is more important than the benefit 
these students gain from accessing my site?<BR>
"2. Why do you think you are more qualified than these teachers to determine 
what our children should see?"
<P>
Seth Finkelstein, a free speech activist based in Boston, has been extensively 
educating the world about blocking software (see 
<A HREF="http://www.mit.edu/activities/safe/labeling/summary.html">www.mit.edu/activities/safe/labeling/summary.html</A>). Finkelstein says: "It's a bait-and-switch maneuver. The censorware makers will use sex panics to get people to 
use their products, but then extend their secret blacklists to all sorts of other 
material, including criticism of them." He has frequently made the point that 
blocking software is not a less restrictive alternative to government censorship; it 
is the first step toward government intervention. The inevitable second step is that 
laws will be passed making use of blocking software mandatory.
<P>
Finkelstein is right. Bills pending in California, Minnesota and Florida would do 
just that. California Senate bill AB132, for example, would require all school 
districts to buy blocking software. If these schools respond by purchasing 
Cybersitter, then Solid Oak will become the official arbiter of what California 
schoolchildren can see on the Internet--and they won't be able to see <I>The 
Ethical Spectacle</I>, "An Auschwitz Alphabet," Peacefire or NOW.
<P>
Just think about that.
