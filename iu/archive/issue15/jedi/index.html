<I>A long time ago (20 years, to 
be exact) in a galaxy (or more likely a cineplex) far, far away (so far that your mom 
probably had to drive you there)...</I>
<P>
1997 is a big year for Star Wars fans. To mark the original film's 20th anniversary, Star 
Wars director and creator George Lucas, using the latest technologies, has retooled the 
original film and the two sequels, adding some cut scenes, enhancing the special effects 
and reworking the soundtrack . 
<P>
In fact, as you read this, the new version of the first film is playing on some 1,800 
screens nationwide (compared to the paltry 32 screens of the original's debut). <I>Star 
Wars</I> fanatics won't have to wait three years this time for a sequel; a re-tooled 
version of <I>The Empire Strikes Back</I> hits theaters on Feb. 21, with a refurbished 
print of <I>Return of the Jedi</I> following on March 7. 
<P>
Tweaking a masterpiece is a risky proposition. The results can be stunning, as was the 
case with the extensive cleaning of Michelangelo's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel or the 
director's cut of <I>Blade Runner</I>. But more often, the new rendition resembles 
something like <I>Frampton Comes Alive II</I> or the colorized version of 
<I>Casablanca</I>. 
<P>
Nowhere has the debate over the new version been more fiercely deliberated than on the 
Net, where purists and revisionists have been trading salvos on the <I>Star Wars</I> 
newsgroups for months. If nothing else, the new films have given <I>Star Wars</I> 
aficionados bigger issues to discuss than whether Boba Fett is a woman or if Princess 
Leia could beat up <I>Star Trek: The Next Generation</I>'s Counselor Troi. 
<P>
So why mess with a classic? The answer seems to be twofold. George Lucas is 
notoriously press-shy, but he provides the following explanation at the <I>Star Wars: 
Special Edition</I> Web site (www.starwars.com): "There were various things, 
especially in the original film, that I wasn't satisfied with--special effects shots that never 
were really finished, scenes that I'd wanted to include that couldn't be included for some 
reason, mostly money and time. I really wanted to fix the films and have them be 
complete."
<P>
While Lucas may claim that his main purpose in retooling the films was to perfect 
them, clearly the special editions are being used to prime the pump of skywalker fever in 
anticipation of the release of the first film of a new <I>Star Wars</I> trilogy 
in 1999. The new trio of films are actually a prequel to the original trilogy and will focus 
on young Anakin Skywalker (Darth Vader before he went bad) and his relationship with 
Luke's and Leia's mom. 
<P>
On the Net, the <I>Star Wars</I> franchise ranks right up there in popularity with 
<I>Star Trek</I> and <I>The X-Files</I> in the holy geek trinity. For instance, the 
name Luke Skywalker returns a staggering 5,230 hits in the Hotbot search engine--
placing the young Jedi nearly neck-and-neck with Capt. Kirk (5,295) but well behind Fox 
Mulder (7,580) in this highly unscientific means of measuring Net popularity. 
<P>
Better evidence of the film's online devotion can be found at the Internet Movie 
Database (www.imdb.com). There, <I>Star Wars</I> reigns as king at the top of a 
user poll of  the 250 greatest movies of all time (<I>Empire</I> is 27th and 
<I>Jedi</I> is 64th). In addition, on a weekly basis, Star Wars is consistently among 
the top 10 visited pages among the site's 87,000-plus entries. 
<P>
Col Needham, the IMDB's managing director, speculates that the film is so highly 
regarded by netizens because "(A) It is a good movie and (B) if you think about the 
average  age of the bulk of Net users, most were kids when <I>Star Wars</I> was 
either in its first run or one of the re-releases, so it's a natural favorite--maybe it was the 
first big movie they got to see at a theater."
<P>
Glen Duchacek, Creator of Glen's <I>Star Wars</I> Archives (see review in 
sidebar), says that the Star Wars craze is not entirely a recent development. "I have been 
connected for almost two years and Star Wars was still really popular then.  As the last 
two years have progressed, I have seen an increase in the <I>Star Wars</I> 
support on the Net."
<P>
Fandom permeates the entire Internet. There are hundreds of unofficial <I>Star 
Wars</I> Web sites (981 at press time, if you believe Yahoo!), not to mention five 
newsgroups, a mailing list and an IRC channel. "all of the kids (myself included) that 
were into <I>Star Wars</I> when it was first released are now earning money and 
have access to computers and the Internet.  Which means they can purchase the new 
range of figures and can communicate to other fans via the Internet about various 
<I>Star Wars</I> topics," Duchacek says.
<P>
So, what makes a good <I>Star Wars</I> site?  Jason Ruspini, creator of the Star 
Wars Home Page at UPENN (see review in below), which is often cited as one of the 
best fan sites, says there are three key elements:  news of upcoming films, multimedia 
files, and obscure and irreverent files (trivia, bloopers, humor, behind-the-scenes stories, 
etc.). Beyond that, Ruspini says a good site should have "(an) excellent but not 
necessarily complicated graphical design and be as interactive as possible.
 <P>
"I think that if a site has most of these core elements and chooses a unique focus, it is a 
good <I>Star Wars</I> site. Of course, you can do what I tried to do and build a 
totally comprehensive one. I think sites like that for any subject are important because 
they help to set standards for the depth of information content on the web."
<P>
And while Fox and Viacom have made recent overtures toward shutting down 
unofficial <I>X-Files</I> and <I>Star Trek</I> sites, it appears the creators of 
<I>Star Wars</I> fan sites can breathe easy, at least for now. 
Last April, Ruspini received a phone call from a Lucasfilm representative. Ruspini was 
told in no uncertain terms that his site violated copyrights and he'd have to shut it down. 
As soon as this news hit the Net, <I>Star Wars</I> fanatics quickly mobilized, 
forming the Star of Alderaan (named for the highest honor awarded to heroes of the Rebel 
Alliance) to protest the crackdown. Lucasfilm retreated, sending Ruspini a letter, which is 
currently posted at his site, that said they were by no means 
trying to shut down his site. "Lucasfilm appreciates <I>Star Wars</I> fans' 
support...Since the Internet is growing so fast, we are in the process of developing 
guidelines for how we can enhance the ability of <I>Star Wars</I> fans to 
communicate with each other without infringing on <I>Star Wars</I> copyrights and 
trademarks." 
<P>
Lucasfilm has yet to furnish those guidelines to Ruspini or the Net community. Perhaps 
they realized that rather than chase down college students who copied and pasted a 
picture of Chewbacca to their sites, they should concentrate their efforts on making their 
own official site vibrant and indispensable. A look at the 
official site reveals that the decision paid off (see review below).

<A HREF="http://www.frii.com/~joe/bf_home.html"><B>The Boba Fett Home Page</B></A><BR>
Everything you really wanted to know about the reticent bounty hunter, but were 
afraid to ask. Some of the questions probed here: <I>Are Han and Boba 
brothers? Is Boba a third Skywalker? What's so cool about Boba Fett, anyway? 
</I> At one point, it was hip in certain circles to claim that your favorite character 
was Boba Fett, but in recent years Fett-fetishism has gone way mainstream, as 
witnessed here by the links page that lists a staggering number of other Fett 
pages.
<P>

<A HREF="http://www.jedinet.com/coolswsite/"><B>Cool <I>Star Wars</I> Site of the Week</B></A><BR>
Perhaps the ultimate badge of honor in the galaxy of <I>Star Wars</I> Web sites 
is the CSWSOW icon, a sign that your site has risen above the morass of the 
Dagobah swamp of ordinary pages and is now shining with the intensity of 100 
lightsabers. 
<P>

<A HREF="http://www.evan.org/sw.html"><B>Evan Strikes Back</B></A><BR>
A great comprehensive site with a sense of humor. Check out the particularly 
good "Cut Scenes" page and don't miss the report from Evan's dinner with David 
Prowse (the actor in the Darth Vader costume).
<P>

<A HREF="http://www.dcs.rhbnc.ac.uk/~glen/sw.html"><B>Glen's <I>Star Wars</I> Archive</B></A><BR>
A great place to bone up on your Star Wars acumen. Glen, a college student 
from the U.K., has many buried treasures at his site including George Lucas' 
alternate draft of the original film in which, among other things, Luke Starkiller 
(not Skywalker) lives at home with his twin sister Leia, and C3PO has a beefed-
up role which includes flying an X-Fighter side-by-side with Luke in the final 
scenes. Not a lot of bells and whistles, but packed with arcane information. 
<P>

<A HREF="http://www.jedinet.com/"><B>JediNet</B></A><BR>
Yet another massive repository of <I>Star Wars</I> trivialities and treatises. 
Highlights include: <I>Star Wars</I> philosophy (one would-be Marge Schott has 
the audacity to say that the Empire was basically good), Obi-Wan's weekly trivia 
contest and monthly polls on subjects such as which of the three <I>Star 
Wars</I> films is the best (surprisingly, <I>Jedi</I> won). 
<P>

<A HREF="http://weber.u.washington.edu/~schell/swdg_intro.html"><B>Jeff's Guide to the <I>Star Wars</I> Drinking Game</B></A><BR>
You know the drill. Get a case of Schlitz, invite some of your buddies over, pop 
Star Wars in the VCR and drink on cue. The <I>Star Wars</I> game is actually a 
lot more complicated than the original "Hi Bob" drinking game in which would-be 
drunkards only had to take a sip when someone on the <I>Bob Newhart Show 
</I>uttered the requisite greeting. Among the occasions to drink when watching 
the trilogy: when anybody insults the Millennium Falcon (twice, if it's Leia), when 
a Stormtrooper's armor proves useless and when Yoda uses bad grammar.
<P>

<A HREF="http://5ss.simplenet.com/swafw/index.html"><B><I>Star Wars</I> Action Figure Web</B></A><BR>
Your first stop if you're an action figure aficionado. Here, you'll find photos of 
virtually every action figure ever produced (and some that were never produced). 
Wait until you see the JPEGs of the Mexican Obi-Wan figure, the Polish Boba 
Fett figure and the Turkish Darth Vader figure. 
<P>

<A HREF="http://www.nni.com/~spanky/swcc1~1.htm"><B><I>Star Wars</I> Collector Circle</B></A><BR>
This site is a "scalper-free zone," meaning there's nothing being bought or sold; 
rather, this is the place for <I>Star Wars</I> enthusiasts to trade toys and 
memorabilia. Before entering the trade areas, check out the monthly newsletter 
or swap rumors in the "Imperial Whispers" area. 
<P>

<A HREF="http://www.universal.nl/users/DWijnberg/swmpage.htm"><B><I>Star Wars</I> Encyclopedia</B></A><BR>
From Alderaan to Zuckuss, this encyclopedia is a great place for young Jedis 
and Jedi masters alike to get the lowdown on every character, setting and ship in 
the Trilogy galaxy. The encyclopedia, the work of a Dutch fan, is completely 
illustrated and cross-referenced with hyperlinks. Don't miss the "Fact or Fiction" 
section for some particularly amusing and enlightening trivia bits. 
<P>

<A HREF="http://www.stwing.upenn.edu/starwars/"><B><I>Star Wars</I> Home Page at UPENN</B></A><BR>
Without question, <I>the</I> unofficial <I>Star Wars</I> site. This massive 
archive has news, pictures, sound files and more. Among the requisite trilogy 
minutiae found here were these nuggets: news that composer John Williams is 
stepping down from the Boston Pops, sexually explicit <I>Star Wars</I> fiction 
and the lyrics to Weird Al's "Yoda" (a parody of the Kinks' "Lola").  
<P>

<A HREF="http://www.kenobi.com/starwars/"><B>The <I>Star Wars</I> Role-playing club</B></A><BR>
Have you dreamt of flying the Millennium Falcon, firing up a lightsaber or trying 
to blow up the Death Star? You're not alone. Why not join the hundreds of other 
fanatics who are using the Net to play <I>Star Wars</I> role-playing games? In 
the same vein as Dungeons and Dragons, the Club invites you to create a 
character that will inhabit a text-based version of the <I>Star Wars</I> galaxy. 
Follow the directions laid out at this site, and you'll be up and flying your own X-
Fighter in no time.

<A HREF="http://www.starwars.com"><B><I>Star Wars</I> Trilogy: The Official Web Site</B></A><BR>
Cut to the chase and get your info on the <I>Star Wars</I> films from the official 
source. This relatively new site is nicely done, but considering the subject area, 
the amount of content is a little on the light side (to their credit, a notice at the 
site states that they are "starting out modestly, just as George Lucas did 20 
years ago"). Highlights at this site include the "What Has Changed" section that 
details the improvements made to the special-edition versions and an essay from 
Lucas himself on why he made the changes. Kudos to the design team for using 
a map of the <I>Star Wars</I> galaxy to organize the site into sections like Hoth, 
the Death Star and Bespin.
<P>

<A HREF="http://www.flash.net/~joem/webring.htm"><B><I>Star Wars</I> Web Ring</B></A><BR>
The goal of this site is to have all the <I>Star Wars</I> sites on the Web linked in 
a giant ring. What purpose this serves is questionable.
<P>

<A HREF="http://www.angelfire.com/pages1/swmag/"><B>Trek vs. Wars</B></A><BR>
Which is better, <I>Star Trek</I> or <I>Star Wars</I>? This site, really just an 
essay, attempts to answer this eternal question. But rather than comparing the 
competing sci-fi franchises' plotlines, acting or character development, this 
Webmaster focuses on which universe has bigger guns and cooler ships. While 
we wait for someone to objectively compare the considerable histrionics of Mark 
Hamill and William Shatner, we'll have to make due with biased commentary like 
this: "<I>Star Wars</I> focuses on making the people enjoy the movies while 
<I>Star Trek</I> don't care as long as they satisfy their fellow nerds 
by presenting logical scientific explanations for everything that happens."
<P>

<A HREF="http://orion.it.luc.edu/~sberks/wedge.html"><B>The Wedge Antilles Worship Page</B></A><BR>
Amazingly, this is just one of eight pages we found dedicated to Wedge, the only 
rebel pilot besides Luke to survive all three films. Here, you'll find an interview 
with the actor who played Wedge, an explanation for this obscure character's 
popularity and best of all, a collection of famous Wedge quotes like "Going in!" 
and "Look at the size of that thing!"
<P>

<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/hills/6007/"><B>You Know You're A <I>Star Wars</I> Geek When...</B></A><BR>
Putting a new twist on the tiresome Jeff Foxworthy comedic schtick, this site will 
help you determine if you are merely a fan or if you should seek psychiatric help. 
Among the signs of <I>Star Wars</I> geekdom: "You know more about the 
history of Dagobah than you do about Earth" and "You're wondering, 'Why the 
hell am I reading this crap? I could be watching <I>Star Wars</I> right now!"
