&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From the bridge of the aircraft carrier Akagi, Adm. Chuichi Nagumo peered across 
the tranquil Pacific toward Midway Island. Three hours had passed since he 
launched 108 planes against the tiny atoll. A victory here, the Pearl Harbor veteran 
knew, would allow his fleet to advance on Hawaii and then threaten the West Coast 
of the United States. Midway would be Japan's passageway east.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Even though his air strike at dawn had destroyed Midway's fuel supply and 
decimated the island's fighter squadrons, Nagumo was worried. One of his scouts 
had reported an enemy aircraft carrier 200 miles away and nearing. No carriers 
should be nearby, Nagumo thought. He expected no U.S. ships and little resistance. 
Midway was to be an easy target, like Pearl Harbor had been six months before.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nagumo didn't know about the codebreaking genius of the Combat Intelligence 
Unit, a group of three U.S. cryptanalysts in Pearl Harbor's Navy yard. They monitored 
all major and most minor Japanese fleet circuits and had succeeded in tunneling 
into the Japanese JN25b cipher and its internal time and place encoding. On May 
28, 1942, six days before Nagumo aimed his Zeroes at Midway, 
the codebreakers handed Adm. Chester Nimitz the complete tactical plan the 
Japanese would use in 
the battle.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the morning of June 4, three carriers from Nimitz's Pacific fleet waited on 
Admiral Nagumo's flank. Still unaware of the extent of the threat to the northeast, 
Nagumo recalled his interceptors, which were low on gas after swarming on Midway. 
He decided they should land, refuel and replace their bombs with the 250 kg 
torpedoes that could do more damage to enemy ships. The laborious process took 
two hours.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The delay proved deadly. U.S. planes attacked soon afterwards. Dive-bombers 
from the Enterprise and Yorktown screamed down and soon three of Nagumo's four 
carriers were ablaze. Nagumo would say later of the Soryu, "Fires enveloped the 
whole ship in no time." She 
was abandoned 30 minutes later. Nagumo's last carrier, Hiryu, sank the next day.
Thanks to the Pearl Harbor cryptanalysts, Japan's eastward advance had been 
halted. The remnants of the once-proud First Air Fleet limped west in hasty retreat. 
An inferior U.S. force had defeated 
a Japanese armada. American codebreaking had turned the tide of a war.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
World War II was when cryptology, the science of reading and 
writing secrets, came into its own. By cracking the Nazis' Enigma machine, Allied 
cryptanalysts saved the world a year of war in Europe. The decoding of Japan's 
diplomatic ciphers lent a sorely needed edge to the Allied war efforts in the Pacific. 
Codebreaking also led to the United States shooting down Adm. Isoroku 
Yamamoto's personal airplane near Guadalcanal, a move that struck a heavy blow to 
Japanese morale.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Modern wars have highlighted the military benefits of codemaking and 
codebreaking--together called cryptology--but ciphers and codes have existed for 
millennia. Julius Caesar wrote to Cicero in a cipher similar to Usenet's ROT-13 that 
replaced letters with the characters three places further down the alphabet. The 
Greeks invented a cryptographic signaling system that replaced letters with two-digit 
numbers from 11 to 55. Roger Bacon, an English monk who lived in the 13th 
century, wrote: "A man is crazy who writes a secret in any other way than one which 
will conceal it from the vulgar."

<B>Modern Encryption</B>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For all its bewildering jargon, the concept of cryptography is straightforward: a 
sender wants to write a message and prevent an eavesdropper from understanding 
it. This can be done through encryption and 
encipherment, which scramble or rearrange the components of a message, or 
through a code in which one phrase represents another. Modern computers use 
ciphers.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ever since the ciphers of the Greeks and Romans, covert writing techniques have 
relied on the sender and recipient holding identical copies of a "key," usually a 
secret phrase that both parties must agree on before they can communicate. (The 
Confederates showed remarkable optimism but little prescience when choosing the 
phrase "COMPLETE VICTORY" as a key for Civil War ciphers.) That technique, 
however, limits the system's usefulness. If Alice wants to send a message 
to Bob and they haven't decided on a key, how can they communicate privately?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
They can't. An eavesdropper could intercept a key if Bob sent it 
to Alice. Until, at least, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman invented public-key 
cryptography in 1975.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now Alice can send a private message to Bob, even if they've never met. In 
public-key cryptography, each correspondent owns a 
private key and a public key, which often is published in a directory. Think of the 
technique as creating a public mailbox; anyone can drop letters in the mailbox, but 
only the person with the right key can remove them. This development marked the 
end of special key couriers with black bags and the beginning of software like Phil 
Zimmermann's Pretty Good Privacy.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Law enforcement agencies and the National Security Agency weren't exactly 
pleased by these advancements. They contend that crypto is dangerous in the 
wrong hands, which is why the Clinton administration continues to treat encryption 
products as though they were munitions. For export purposes, crypto is treated as a 
B-2 stealth bomber or an M-1 Abrams tank. An executive order, which succeeded 
the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), requires firms to seek licenses 
to ship crypto overseas.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The U.S. government's view stems from when encryption was largely the province 
of soldiers and spies. Indeed, the science of cryptology owes much of its 
advancement to codebreakers and codemakers who worked for governments. But 
the world has changed. Computers are no longer a military monopoly. Strong crypto 
is needed online. Public-key cryptography, besides ensuring that your messages are 
secure, can also identify who you're communicating with or buying from online. It 
provides the protocols for scrambling credit-card numbers and generating digital 
coins. It allows digital signatures, proofs of identity online, digital time stamps and 
even secure electronic voting. It lets anonymous remailers exist. It provides for 
secure telnet connections. Crypto provides the foundation 
and steel girders for an information society.

<B>Munition or Net-Necessity?</B>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Encryption presents the Feds with an unwelcome dilemma: It yields hefty benefits 
when used to secure networks, but presents law enforcement agencies with real 
drawbacks when agents try in vain to read a suspect's seized e-mail.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This schizophrenic policy betrayed itself when the Clinton administration 
introduced the Clipper Chip in April 1993. The White House tried to pass off the 
device as offering users superior encryption capabilities at the small price of 
ensuring continued government access to encrypted communications. The plan, 
crafted by the NSA, was for the government to hold master copies of keys "in 
escrow" until needed by law enforcement. The scheme met with savage opposition 
and the Clipper Chip soon sunk.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That miserable failure hasn't prevented FBI director Louis Freeh from launching 
his own attacks on crypto. In alarmist speeches, he repeatedly has linked strong 
encryption to terrorists such as the Oklahoma City bombers. Freeh told Congress 
that "unbreakable encryption" will "seriously and fundamentally threaten" public 
safety. "The potential use of such robust encryption products by a vast array of 
criminals and terrorists to conceal their criminal communications and information 
poses an extremely serious and, in my view, unacceptable threat to public safety," 
he said. (Attorney General Janet Reno and Jamie Gorelick, deputy attorney general, 
have echoed the FBI chief, and documents that the Electronic Privacy Information 
Center obtained under the Freedom of Information Act demonstrate that the bureau 
would like to outlaw encryption that doesn't have a backdoor for the government.)
Still, Freeh speaks some truth. If crypto is widespread, it <I>will</I> hinder the 
FBI's ability to wiretap. It <I>will</I> allow miscreants to encrypt files in a manner 
impervious to prosecutors' most determined attacks. It <I>will</I> make it more 
difficult for the NSA to scan international phone calls in bulk for code words that 
hint at illicit activity. It <I>will</I> hinder convictions--but then again, so do 
Miranda rights. To Freeh, controls on encryption are a matter of restoring the 
"balance" that's tilting away from law enforcement. "In a very fundamental way, 
conventional encryption has the effect of upsetting the delicate legal balance of the 
Fourth Amendment, since when a judge issues a search warrant it will be of no 
practical value when this type of encryption is encountered," he said.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What Freeh neglects to mention is how the scales are already tipped in favor of 
the FBI. Modern communications technologies make it possible for law enforcement 
agents to collect an unprecedented amount of information on ordinary citizens 
without their knowledge. Digital technology allows governments to do a much more 
thorough job of monitoring an ordinary person's actions and opinions than ever 
before. If the Justice Department ransacks your home, you'll know it. Not so when 
your communications are digital and are culled from a mail server without 
your knowledge. Crypto restores the balance of privacy.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"It's an effort by the government to permanently shift the power in favor of 
surveillance," ACLU privacy guru Don Haines says. "This occurs in a digital medium, 
where for the first time we can make Big Brother real. Before, the manpower 
required was prohibitive. Now it's digital. You set your computers to search for a 
particular sequence of bits."
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This view is not new. Thirty years ago, Alan Westin wrote in his book <I>Privacy 
and Freedom</I> that "the issue of privacy raised by computerization is whether 
the increased collection and processing of information for diverse public and private 
purposes, if not carefully controlled, could lead to a sweeping power of surveillance 
by government over individual lives and organizational activity."
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
His remarks would prove prophetic.

<B>U.S. Businesses: Out of Business?</B>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
American businesses have launched their own offensive to 
support encryption. They contend that their overseas competitors aren't hindered by 
ITAR and are free to sell strong encryption around the globe. Execs have told 
Congress for years that current regulations cost U.S. industry millions. They point to 
RSA Data Security's decision to license its patents to NTT, a Japanese firm. They 
warn that European or Asian software makers may drive U.S. firms off the encryption 
playing field forever.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The White House reacted swiftly to the complaints. Clinton recently appointed a 
crypto-ambassador to lobby foreign governments to comply with U.S. rules and 
move toward a global framework requiring key escrow. If successful, the move would 
nullify the industry's argument; after all, foreign firms would be equally hobbled. 
"What we need to do, very clearly, is to spend a lot of time with other countries," 
says William Reinsch, Commerce Department undersecretary for export 
administration.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The debate grew even hotter when Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Montana) introduced a 
bill last spring that would lift export controls. With White House arm-twisting--some 
reports say Clinton himself worked the phones--and adept lobbying by the Justice 
Department, the legislation perished. Sen. Jim Exon (D-Nebraska), proud sponsor of 
the Communications Decency Act, personally dealt the death blow by blocking the 
proposal from leaving the Commerce Committee. Burns plans to reintroduce "Pro-
CODE" legislation this year.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The other way to skirt the export embargo is through the courts. The Electronic 
Frontier Foundation scored an early victory in its legal attack on the regulations last 
December when a Federal judge in San Francisco ruled that ITAR was 
unconstitutional. Another case is moving through the D.C. Federal appeals court, 
which heard oral arguments last month.

Clinton responded to these legislative and judicial attacks by signing an executive 
order on Nov. 15, 1996 that he billed as a "compromise," but in truth it only 
transferred jurisdiction over encryption exports from the State Department to the 
Commerce Department. The regulations remain almost entirely the same. Clinton 
wrote at the time, almost parroting Freeh, that "encryption products, when used 
outside the United States, can jeopardize our foreign policy and national security 
interests...The exportation of encryption products accordingly must be controlled to 
further U.S. foreign policy objectives, and promote our national security, including 
the protection of the safety of U.S. citizens abroad."

Attached to Clinton's executive order was another reason for privacy advocates to 
cry foul: a "key recovery" proposal. It's Clipper with a twist, a divide-and-conquer 
strategy designed to splinter an industry previously united in opposition. It slightly 
relaxed rules on exporting crypto only for those businesses that pledge to devise a 
key escrow system ensuring government access to keys.  That presents Silicon 
Valley companies with a kind of unholy prisoner's dilemma--if you don't buy into this 
plan, your competitor will. Faced with the prospect of hanging together 
or hanging separately, some hardware manufacturers already have signed up.

<B>Security through Complex Mathematics</B>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ironically, the Federal government may have done more than anyone else to 
further the spread of encryption. In 1975, it unveiled the Data Encryption Standard 
(DES), arguably still the world's most popular data-scrambling algorithm. It proved 
reasonably fast and apparently secure, even after the National Security Agency 
weakened the final version. However, the NSA had made a crucial mistake: they 
believed the National Institute of Standards and Technology would publish 
specifications only for a hardware version of DES.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Instead, enough information appeared in the Federal Register to allow 
programmers to write DES applications. Soon, they became widely available, 
bringing reasonable digital privacy to anyone with a personal computer. The 
explosion of personal computers allowed more people to encrypt files with DES than 
the NSA ever imagined. Chastened officials say privately that, from the standpoint of 
national security, DES was the worst mistake the NSA ever made.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The debate over what encryption products can be exported revolves around the 
strength of the application's key; longer keys are more difficult for an attacker to 
break. The Commerce Department permits firms to export 40-bit DES, or 56-bit 
DES with a pledge to develop "key recovery" products.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Symmetric algorithms like DES use keys often ranging from 40 bits to 128 bits, 
with an 8-bit key having 28--or 256--possible values. Guessing that key takes 256 
attempts, with a 50 percent chance of finding the correct key after 128 tries. 
Beware short key lengths: an attacker with custom hardware can crack a 40-bit DES 
key in milliseconds and a 56-bit key in just minutes. But a 128-bit key requires an 
adversary to wait perhaps 1017 years--or longer than the known age of the 
universe! No wonder the NSA is lamenting. (Public-key cryptosystems like PGP 
calculate the security of key lengths differently. A 128-bit PGP key is woefully 
inadequate; a 1024-bit PGP key is reasonably safe.)

<B>Crypto-Revolutionaries</B>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The debate swirling through Capitol Hill conference rooms and the corridors of the 
White House revolves around one basic question: What role should the government 
play in regulating encryption?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The founding fathers might be startled by the Byzantine rules. After all, some 
revolutionaries were cryptographers themselves. Benjamin Franklin in 1781 crafted 
a substitution cipher based on a 682-character French phrase. James Madison 
created a code replacing words with two- and three-digit numbers that he used until 
1793.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But by far the most remarkable cryptologist of the Revolutionary War was the 
author of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson, who between 1790 
and 1800 invented a cipher system so far ahead of its time that it remained in use 
even into the late 20th century.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He called it his "wheel cypher." One design consisted of a six-inch rod  with 36 
wheels on it, each with an alphabet scrambled in a different order. The wheels can 
be rearranged for different correspondents for a total of 36 factorial, or 37 x 1040 
possible combinations.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In <I>The Codebreakers</I>, historian David Kahn writes: "Jefferson's wheel 
cypher was far and away the most advanced devised in his day...Had the President 
recommended his own system to Secretary of State James Madison, he would have 
endowed his country with a method of secret communication that would almost 
certainly have withstood any cryptanalytic attack of those days. Instead 
he appears to have filed andforgotten it."
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To Jefferson, the will and welfare of the people--not federal bureaucrats--were the 
prop and purpose of government. His deepest trust lay in the wisdom of citizens to 
use freedom wisely and in a belief that the essence of democracy was a central 
government limited in power. Perhaps, when contemplating encryption regulations, 
Bill Clinton could learn something from his renowned predecessor.
