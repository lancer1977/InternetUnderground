<B>Once upon a time,</B> people started deadbolting their doors 
at night. The response by the criminal community? To start fashioning 
lockpicking sets. And ever since, those humans harboring an urge to snoop, 
steal and penetrate have matched wits with property owners intent on protecting 
their assets. 
<P>
Similarly, soon after the first copyright-protected computer program hit the 
consumer market, programs to strip that copyright protection began to circulate. 
Back in the days when an Apple IIc with a 400 baud modem was 
considered high tech, groups of devoted technophiles were using Locksmith 2.0 
to crack the popular text adventures of the era.
<P>
They had concluded that making duplicates of Zork was better sport than 
<I>playing</I> it. 
<P>
The hobby wasn't such a big deal back then. The digital revolution was still 
underground. Distribution was minimal, and piracy was mostly conducted by 
small, private groups. But the sheer corpulence of  today's software market, 
coupled with the rapid growth of the Internet, has changed all that. The potential 
for the distribution of pirated software, or <I>warez</I>, as it's commonly called, 
on a global computer network is mind-boggling. In just a day's time, one pirated 
file can spawn many thousands of copies. In fact, there are <I>thousands</I> of 
people exchanging thousands of pirated files each day. Clearly, 
the financial loss to software developers is immense. 
<P>
Many ingenious copyrightprotection methods have been developed to stop 
this blood loss--only to be bested by equally ingenious methods of 
circumvention. For instance, when CD-ROMs became standard issue, software 
companies began 
producing games so large that copying, by any means other than actually 
burning expensive CD duplicates, would have been impractical. The 
warezaholics' response? Shrink file size by removing the soundtrack, video and 
extra animation sequences, and then release the bits and pieces separately--
kind of like plug-ins for Netscape. The escalating sophistication of the war has 
honed technical excellence on both sides of the fence. 
<P>
Warez trading has become an integral part of cyber-life for many and a full-
blown addiction for others. The scene has evolved from its once-insulated origins 
into a thriving subculture. 
<P>
Every aspect of the Net is exploited by the warez scene. Some Usenet 
groups are dedicated to the trading of pirated files, and the Web is a cornucopia 
of intertwining tendrils of hyperlinked file downloads. The core of the scene, 
however, is on IRC. That's where you'll find the channels where software fiends 
trade files, advertise sites and discuss warez in general. Some channels even 
have what are referred to as "offer botz," which are automated programs, 
capable of maintaining multiple high-speed connections, that will send files to 
you upon request 24 hours a day. In fact, there are channels that consist of 
nothing <I>but</I> offer botz. 
<P>
Where are all of these pirated files coming from? At the backbone of it all are 
the "release groups," the organizations that crack and release the pirated 
software, or "rip it and zip it." Much like well-known cliques, release groups 
maintain a high profile and take a great deal of pride in their accomplishments. 
People vie to join the established groups. Each piece of warez contains a text file 
that tells a bit about the group that released it, lists its members and gives credit 
to all those responsible for the particular release. Sometimes the group creates 
elaborate programs to simplify the installation on the end user's computer, and 
full-motion video, music and 3-D graphics are not uncommon. 
<P>
There are several roles in a release group. To begin with, there's the supplier. 
A supplier is the one who actually supplies the original piece of software, and 
usually is  someone who works in, or is somehow connected to, a computer 
store. 
<P>
Then you have the crackers. These scriptmeisters are the elite gearheads 
who rip, strip and reformat the software until it's ready for mass distribution. 
<P>
Next in line is the site operator. Site ops run the release sites,  FTP servers 
where newly released warez are stored. 
<P>
Last, but not least, are the couriers. Couriers download the warez from the 
release sites. They then upload it to public sites for distribution, using T1 and T3 
accounts to transfer files at speeds well in excess of  1,000kbps. Elite couriers 
are known to move amounts of warez more easily measured in gigabytes than 
megabytes. 
<P>
One warezaholic offered this explanation for his illegal hobby: "It's bullshit 
that the only people that have access to great software are businesses and 
wealthy individuals. Some of the better graphics applications cost upward of 
$200. Your average computer user can't afford that just to experiment with, so a 
lot of great artwork may be lost because economic factors keep a would-be artist 
from discovering his potential."
<P>
Is copying Photoshop for a friend tremendously different from making a tape 
of music from your collection? How about copying movies rented from 
Blockbuster? Can piracy even be qualified?
<P>
Not really. Robin Hood analogies and justifications of altruism or revenge 
don't make the theft of software any less illegal. And although it's rarely admitted, 
greed is often the driving factor. 
<P>
The more the Net becomes integrated into the global 
community's daily existence, the greater the demand and pressure the 
networked community will  feel to obtain and share task- 
specific software. Conversely, the more users share task-specific software, the 
more diligent copyright holders will have to become to protect their investments.
<P>
Beyond the obvious copyright infringement issues, combatants in the warez 
battle have to consider a number of concerns: illegal use of telephone lines, 
possession with intent to distribute copyright-protected material, use of network 
servers to commit a felony crime and intercontinental smuggling of contraband. 
<P>
Is software piracy the organized crime of the 21st  century? Or will the 
software bandits of today go on to become the 
programming gurus of tomorrow, and chalk up such activity as 
misspent youth? 
<P>
One ex-police officer, who preferred anonymity for this story, equates battles 
against warez with the Prohibition Amendment. It was never a secret that the 
Prohibition law was being broken, but attempts to prosecute bootleggers were 
futile. Similarly, software piracy is happening everywhere, and will never be 
stopped totally--that would require the dispatch of an officer in every home with 
Net access. 
<P>
In other words, the Warez Wars will rage on...for now.
