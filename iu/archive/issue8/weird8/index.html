Why a llama? The site's creator, Chris Feyrer, explains. "Llamas grab my attention for some reason.  You think 'cow, cow, 
cow (yawn)....
llama...llama?! Where?'  They also are nice and obscure, like the  emu and the ferret.  Hmm.  And they dance like you 
would not believe," Feyrer says. But a llama alone would not capture the imagination of a nation like the one on Feyrer's 
site. Evidently, by adding "naked" and "dancing" to the mix, he stumbled onto something. Feyrer says that his Naked 
Dancing Llama (NDL) has inspired people across the country to don NDL for President T-shirts and preach the 
wisdom of the llama. "A friend of mine who  uses the  pseudonym Xanthippe came up with FONDL, Friend of Naked 
Dancing Llama...kind of an unofficial fan club. Other netsurfers are realizing they should have been asking llamas the 
solutions to their problems long ago." We weren't quite so sure if the llama could answer ours, especially since all the 
tidbits of wisdom from the Hoofed One seem to have something to do with either frolicking or licking, such as 
this bit of llama lore: "Licking salt is no substitute for a 
good macadamia."

Women Are the Root of All Evil? Male or female, woman-hater or avid feminist, you'll likely be amused with this page, as 
misguided misogyny always makes for a fun, cheap laugh. In the words of the author, "The W.A.T.R.O.A.E. organization 
was mainly set up to warn other males about the evils of women, to provide comfort to those males who have to deal 
with women on a daily basis, to try not to understand women, and most importantly to try to provide alternative 
solutions to the survival of man with the extinction of women." As an added bonus, there's a frighteningly awful story 
about 200 dead monkeys. So do we believe women are the root of all evil? Examine our <A HREF="http://www.underground-online.com/ours/">masthead</A> for the 
answer. Notice all the women there...?

Mike and Anthony's Wired Room

Mike Bitz and Anthony Anderberg share 
a dorm room at the University of South Dakota. Small and cramped, it would be otherwise unremarkable except that 
these two programming majors "wired" their room so that visitors can turn on their fan, find out the room's temperature 
at any given moment and shut the hallway door. It takes some hard-core geeks to come up with such a site, we thought, 
so we checked out their bios. We were right. Anthony notes that he "enjoys canoeing, astronomy, bicycling, circuit 
building, weightlifting, Perl scripting and Metallica concerts." Metallica figures heavily in this site, with many references 
in the pair's highly entertaining FAQ. Therein, they answer such pressing questions as "What's the coolest Metallica song 
of all time?" ("Master of Puppets") and "What's the capital of Iceland?" (Reykjavik).

Cigars I Have Smoked

It takes a moment of great inspiration to dedicate a Web site to some form of personal consumption. The Webmaster 
shares his experiences in diary form with different types of cigars from Hemingways to smokes of the "illegal" variety 
such as Upmann Petit Coronas. Each smoking experience, from light up to the last toke, is presented with ambient detail. 
You'll smell the Caribbean Sea as you read the text. A lot of the smoking stories revolve around the Webmaster's 
wedding. But stogie stories are the extent of any potentially erotic honeymoon prose you'll find here. Sometimes a cigar 
is just a cigar.

The Office of Human Radiation Experiments, formed in March 1994, created this site to keep the public informed of Cold 
War experiments that were conducted on humans. Sound tasty? You haven't seen anything yet. Original documents 
detailing experiments and governmental approval to conduct them make The X-Files look like The Brady Bunch. Just what 
do these documents say? Try this: "If it is felt by the contractor that the program involving experimentation with human 
subjects will be of ultimate interest or value to the Atomic Energy Commission it is suggested that such program be 
prepared for submittal to the Commission for their approval." This site includes photos, archived information and a 
telephone number to call if you think you may have been involved in radiation experiments yourself.

The 'zine Sensoria Kollectiv is a collection of amusements that will startle your senses. Narratives, images and 
experiments, such as Red Asphalt, a tantalizing J.G. Ballard-inspired project that couples car-crash stories and 
disturbing photographs of accident victims, are creatively and thoughtfully presented. Sensoria's theme is dark and 
shocking -- not for the weak-of-heart. Don't be fooled by links such as "Hostess Fruit Pies." You're not getting what you 
think you are, unless you've checked out the rest of the 'zine already.  The multimedia and Project One sound features 
are not to be missed.

The John Gotti Tribute Page

Oddly affectionate tribute to Jon Gotti, "alleged mob boss but all-around nice guy." Start with the partially bleeped sound 
clip of Gotti graphically threatening some poor slob, then proceed to loving testimonials from his former neighbors, who 
miss his annual shindigs. One mission of the page is to free Gotti, "currently serving a life sentence in virtual solitary 
without the possibility of parole at one of the worst prisons in the United States, the lockdown Marion Control Unit 
Federal Penitentiary," the site's author notes. Highlights are summaries of Gotti-inspired made-for-TV movies and 
updates on the alleged unfairness of Gotti's trial. We admit we weren't sure if this page was written tongue in cheek. 
Celebrity worship is totally in vogue, though, and if you can stomach the occasional barbarities of 
running with the mafioso crowd, this devoted Gotti-watch might be right up your alley.

Surely you remember the ads from the pages of your childhood comic books. Who could resist Sea-Monkeys, frolicking 
underwater like Neptune, complete with little crowns and scepters? This page notes, "Sea-Monkeys&#174; are amazing pets, 
portable, active, disposable...Watch them as they are born -- watch them as they grow -- watch them as they raise small 
families in the plastic tank you are supplied with! Just remember that they don't appear exactly as illustrated!" 
(Duh!)  Although hope springs eternal, let's  acknowledge that what springs from those packets of "Instant Life" are plain 
ol' brine shrimp. That aside, visit the Worship Page to find bad poetry and tales of woe regarding tragic Sea-Monkey 
mishaps, i.e., "I ate my Sea-Monkeys!"

Todd's Gallery of Pathetic Human Regret

Todd has alphabetized a life of regrets here. Some regrets are serious. ("I regret that we knocked over the bird nest above 
[the] garage and the baby birds fell all over the ground and were hurt.") Some are lewdly sincere. ("To Holly, a voluptuous 
teen: I wasn't able to see you taking a shower through the fence at night like my friend David said he could.") Some are 
just plain nutty ("To Ken: I regret not enjoying it more when your father held you down and insisted that your sister be 
allowed to bite you in retaliation for you biting her.") Overall, Todd's chronicle of missed opportunities showcases a 
world of knives, rebellion, heavy-metal music, thoughtfulness, snot, one-upsmanship and 
the '80s. Voyeurs will get a thrill; others will feel slightly 
disturbed at the frank tone and confessions within.

The Satanic Side

We're not really sure who would hire Satan, but he's looking for some new employment, according to this site. But then, 
who can blame him when you read the way he describes the job he's held since 7000 B.C. "I hate to break the news to 
you, but I'm basically a bureaucrat," the site says. "No fancy bets over people like Job, no appearing to religious fanatics 
in the middle of the desert and offering them kingdoms. I'm a paper pusher." Yes, that's right: Satan is a dweeb. His office 
is much like everyone else's corporate digs, complete with Dilbert cartoons tacked to the door. He even has to go 
outside his office to smoke (although luckily, most of Hell is a designated smoking area).  His credentials seem pretty 
impressive: Harvard MBA,  law degree from Yale and of course, he was the former "Right Hand of God." Like most job 
hunters, he glosses over the one job from which he was fired on his resume, noting that he left Heaven over "creative 
differences" to strike out on his own as a consultant. He boasts many accomplishments as an entrepreneur, from the 
Black Plague, the fall of Rome, the Inquisition, slavery, Pauly Shore and 3-D movies. But still, Satan remembers his job at 
hand, namely collecting souls for eternal damnation. In this case, he makes it easy. If your browser supports forms, you 
can just fill out a few blanks, hit a submit button and voil&aacute; -- you've made a deal with the devil!
