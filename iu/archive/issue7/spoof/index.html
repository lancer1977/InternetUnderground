&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just what is the sincerest 
form of flattery? Imitation, yes. Parody...well, maybe. As made evident by the collective works of Mel Brooks, a parody 
really only works once something has  become an institution. With the transient, quick-pulsed nature of the Web, it 
hasn't taken long for a few sites to become so popular that perhaps they <I>really do</I> fall in the "top 5%." For instance 
there's Yahoo!, which even veteran Web users access daily, even if not all of them will admit it. There's The Spot, 
which was voted Cool Site of the Year for 1995. And don't forget the irrecusable e-zine suck, our daily dose of cynicism. 
There's a good reason everyone on the 'net knows these sites. They're either places we love to use or places we love to 
hate. No matter what their classification, they've risen above the rest of the dreck into a higher echelon -- those sites 
popular and powerful enough to warrant some good-natured, or not-so-good natured fun at their expense. For suck, 
there's sock and blow. The Squat mocks The Spot. What's Snooze lampoons the NCSA's What's New pages. Some of 
the sites, such as sock, are little more than a one-shot punch line, while others such as blow have developed into sites 
that could stand alone on their own merit.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      So what prompted all this mimicry? <I>IU</I> decided to take a peek behind the scenes with some of these site spoofers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Suspiciously similar to a combination of <I>Melrose Place</I> coupled with <I>The Real World</I> with a dash of <I>Baywatch </I>
cheesecake, The Spot offers 'net users the daily episodic ventures of 20-somethings in a wild and crazy, inner-reflective 
Web world that we all read because we can relate, man. Oh yeah, and there's lots of butt shots. What more could we ask 
for?<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Enter The Squat, the cozy life and times of four down-and-out folk livin' in a lovely double wide. "The Spot 
seemed a bit too high and mighty and needed to be wrestled down in the mud with the rest of us," says The Squat's 
Lynn Kyle, who plays Valvoline (currently, the only woman in the crowd). "The Squat seemed to hit The Spot 
perfectly." <BR>

<IMG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=147 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="art/squat.gif" HSPACE=15 VSPACE=15>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Greg Zguta attributes The Squat idea to Josh Hancik, who admired The Spot when it launched ("Boy, were we 
naive!" Zguta says). The pair, along with Georges Saab, Beth Kopine and Betsy Smith began the spoof, says Zguta, as a 
"sort of summer hobby." (Kopine and Smith left the trailer last summer; Kyle moved in last November.) But then the 
The Squat started to develop its own cult following, proven in its active bulletin board section. Their little hobby also 
attracted a lot of attention from the media and Web users. Zguta estimates The Squat has received more than 100,000 
hits since last July, when the site was added to Netscape's What's New and Yahoo's Cool Links.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
E-mail pours in from fans and dissenters alike. "About once a month, I tend to get a proposal," quips Kyle. 
"Sometimes even for marriage."

A friend of ours told us that he liked <I>suck</I> because it was double-spaced. Luckily for its impersonators, this makes suck 
easy to emulate. Steal a bit of code and you've got an instant <I>suck</I>-alike.
<BR>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<I>blow</I>'s creator takes the cynical tone of <I>suck</I> and, using his own wit, creates an intriguing set of commentary on 
topics ranging from censorship to Java security flaws. While it may have started as a parody, <I>blow</I> stands up 
on its own thanks to its humorous biting 
attitude toward technology and those who use it.<BR>
<IMG WIDTH=270 HEIGHT=78 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/blow.gif" HSPACE=15 VSPACE=15>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<I>sock</I>, on the other hand, proudly bills itself as "<I>suck</I> For Dummies," and goes on to provide newbies with step-by-
step 
instructions for accessing and understanding its namesake. Jason Kottke, <I>sock</I>'s 
founder, says the "For Dummies" series of books from IDG Publishing were his first inspiration, especially since some 
of their offerings such as <I>CD-ROMs For Dummies</I> seemed so obviously useless. "<I>Suck</I> was an easy target, since it is 
nothing more than an article and a few pictures," Kottke says. "Who needs an explanation for that?"<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Well, obviously a few people do; even the folks who read <I>suck</I>. When <I>sock</I> was featured on <I>suck</I> on March 14 issue 
(archived at <A HREF="http://www.suck.com/dynasuck/96/03/14/">www.suck.com/dynasuck/96/03/14/</A>), the site received more than 1,700 hits that day.

<TT><B>WHY IT DESERVES TO BE PARODIED:</B></TT> While Netscape has the most full-featured browser, its site is butt-ugly.<BR>

<TT><B>HOW THE PARODY COMPARES:</B></TT> 
In content, Petscape rules pet resources the way Netscape rules Web resources. Petscape is much cuter, though.<BR>

<TT><B>IRONY FACTOR:</B></TT> Netscape highlighted Petscape on its What's New page, then turned around and filed legal 
complaints against the site for trademark infringement.<BR>
 
<TT><B>HIGHLIGHTS:</B></TT> The typos in the stiff legal letter sent from Netscape, found on Petscape's home page.

<P>
<IMG WIDTH=270 HEIGHT=62 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="art/netscape.gif" HSPACE=15 VSPACE=15>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Petscape, a site dedicated to pets and pet lovers created by the "Coconut Boyz," is chock-full of animal pages, 
resources, links and news offered in a format that matches Netscape's home page almost to perfection. And if you're a 
pet lover or owner (yes, even of odd pets, such as sea monkeys or ant farms), this site should be at the same level of 
priority as Netscape in your bookmarks. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, Petscape's experiences outline why creating a parody isn't all fun and similar source coding.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"We had the site up for about four months and then one day we got an e-mail from a www.petscape.com telling us 
to stop listing our site as Petscape since we would be in violation of some sort of copyright," says Scott Yoshinaga, the 
site's creator. "We changed our site name to the Original Petscape and we stopped listing (it in places on the Web). 
But in three days we were listed on Netscape's What's New pages. I am pretty sure the petscape.com people were not 
too thrilled, but we honestly had nothing to do with it."<BR>
<IMG WIDTH=270 HEIGHT=80 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/petscape.gif" HSPACE=15 VSPACE=15>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Netscape's lawyers started their legal posturing in April. If Yoshinaga complies, you'll see a dramatically different 
site by the time this issue hits the newsstand. "[Netscape] asked us to redesign our site and name because it is 
infringing on their GUI [graphical user interface] and name. We have till May 10, 1996, to comply. It was a very 
formal letter and not threatening in any way. I suppose we now must change it all."

Tired of reading about what's new on the Web? Too bad. What's Snooze introduces its site with the disclaimer: "This 
page contains a list of links to the hundreds of thousands of new Web pages that have been created and announced in 
the last 10 minutes. The list is updated each 11 minutes, and the previous listings (now ancient      history) are 
immediately removed and placed on our inaccessible archives server." This site's so hot, the author had to create a 
second version, What's Snooze II. The double farce highlight treasures such as made-up sites "Learn Desperanto in a 
Week"(that's the universal language of despair) and "Better Faster Be$t$eller$" (a site devoted to fictional books such 
as <I>Al Franken is From Mars, Deepak Chopra is from Venus</I>, by William S. Burroughs).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Who would deign to mock the mighty <I>HotWired</I>? Marci Mansfield-Fickes and Bill Pulver would, and they do in their 
"lighthearted but pretentious" <I>UnderWired</I>. The site features humorous and biting articles such as "Type Design vs. 
Legibility -- Who really gives a shit?" and its Overtired/UnderWired section (worth it if only to view the accompanying 
clever graphics). Mansfield-Fickes and Pulver, who both work for a design firm near Philadelphia, were inspired to 
spoof the site after attending a lecture by <I>HotWired</I>'s two designers shortly after its launch. "Two things immediately 
impressed us. One, the incredible potential the Web had as a communications tool that we could immediately hook 
into. And two, how incredibly pretentious and taken with themselves [the <I>HotWired</I> designers] were."<BR>
<IMG WIDTH=270 HEIGHT=68 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/under.gif" HSPACE=15 VSPACE=15>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The best historical feature about <I>UnderWired</I> may be how it got its name. "We were in a meeting in the conference 
room one afternoon at work," explains Pulver. "You see, the conference room is kind of poorly ventilated. That 
particular summer day was getting pretty warm. Marci found herself feeling a little light-headed, and when the chest 
pains started, she had pretty much convinced herself she was having a heart attack.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Making the usual excuses, she absented herself and went straight to the emergency care unit, where the attending 
physician told her that her symptoms were not a heart attack, but a combination of heat, poor ventilation and pressure 
on her rib cage caused by her underwire bra.
"Not being real bright, Marci comes back to the studio and tells me this." Needless to say, <I>UnderWired</I> was a natural 
name choice, and <I>HotWired</I> a natural target. The rest is yet history.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While we've never known anyone to actually order anything from the 2(x)ist Web site, we do know people who like to 
gawk at the pictures, especially that nice fellow in the Y-back thong. But while the pictures of all those ribbed tummies 
and tight butts may entice, Michael "Timberwoof" Roeder found the page got old quickly since it seemingly  hasn't 
changed since its inception.<BR>
<IMG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=156 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/fur.gif" HSPACE=15 VSPACE=15>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So during a rush of spare time ("meaning I was unemployed," he clarifies), Roeder was hit with the idea to create 
2(b)Furry. "It was then a matter of putting the images together, getting some of my stuffies to agree to be 
photographed, manipulating images from the 2(x)ist site, and writing the HTML." Poof, we've now got a resource for 
teddy bear underwear and the bear in the Y-back thong should not to be missed. Bear in mind, the site takes credit card 
orders, but accepts only Furrican Express, MasterFur, FURA or Discofur.

<TT><B>REAL THING:</B></TT> Point Communications Top 5% of All Web Sites, 
http://www.pointcom.com/

<TT><B>PARODY: Bottom of the Net Awards, http://www.halcyon.com/cbutton/bottom95.htm

<TT><B>WHY IT DESERVES TO BE PARODIED: The Point pretends to be an arbiter of quality, but in fact gives out the 
awards to encourage traffic to their for-profit site.

<TT><B>HOW THE PARODY COMPARES: 
Just like the Point, virtually anyone can 
get the award.

<TT><B>IRONY FACTOR: Claiming to be in the Bottom 95% of the Web is probably much more accurate than vice versa.

<TT><B>HIGHLIGHTS: Everyone may already be a winner without buying any magazines.

Doesn't it seem like every site we browse  now claims to fall in the Top 5% of the Web? If you're sick of a marketing 
gimmick masquerading as a merit program, head over to The Bottom of The Net Awards and pick yourself up some 
esteem along with a nice little emblem for your Web page. All you have to do to win an award (such as The InfoSuck 
Fool Site) is to answer a few questions correctly. If you pass, tag that GIF right on to your page. Sample questions 
include "Did your spouse give you a 'wedgie' while you were sleeping?," "Can you hum 'God Save the Queen' or 'O 
Canada?'" and "Does the 'Father of Shareware' have to  provide links to your page so that you can get an occasional 
hit?"
You understand that odd question when you realize that Conrad Knopf, the propagator of the Bottom awards page 
is  brother to "Shareware Father" Jim Knopf. 
That relation was part of his inspiration for the site. Conrad was simply jealous.
"I saw all the awards that my brother had won," says Conrad. "Everywhere I surfed, awards, awards, awards. I 
decided to create my own award so that I wouldn't be left out. Then I decided to create another award so that I could 
display two of them. Then three, then four. I was possessed with award creation." Now anyone can share Knopf's 
awards, provided they've never won any others. 
Ironically, Knopf now gives out a "real" award, billed as the Warm Award. Only sites that could be considered 
neither hot and nor cool qualify to win. Or, as the award-winning Conrad Knopf puts it, "This is an award for the fairly 
decent."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Infinet's Cool Site of the Day may not be the most parodied site on the Web, but it certainly wins the prize for most 
imitated. That's what bugged "Professor" Falken, a 17-year-old high school senior, who decided to make fun of all the 
lemming-like copycats.
So late one night, Falken created The Same Site of the Day. Since the award goes to the same site every day, it's a 
perfect low-maintenance site. (Actually, it's no-maintenance. "Even if I wanted to change it, I can't," points out 
Falken). Falken claims he even forgot about it after he put it up, until he started getting e-mail about the site, then 
found it was listed at Yahoo!, the Point and Magellan. It's even been chosen as a "site of the day" on several occasions, 
which Falken finds ironic, since he's getting coverage from the very people he's making fun of.

<IMG WIDTH=270 HEIGHT=49 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="art/yahoo.gif" VSPACE=15 HSPACE=15>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As one of the first major directional elements on the Web and arguably one of the most influential sites created (see 
<A HREF="http://www.underground-online.com/archive/issue6/top11/">"The 11 Sites that Revolutionalized the Internet,"</A> IU #6), Yahoo! has continually evolved in order to stay also one of 
the most popular Web destinations.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All of the lampoons of Yahoo!  have taken on the familiar Yahoo! look, with a bit of a difference in the category 
structure.<BR>
<IMG WIDTH=270 HEIGHT=43 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/gilmoo.gif" VSPACE=15 HSPACE=15>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Take Gilmoo!, based on the long-time 'net username of its author, Massachusetts Institute of Technology student 
Eric Gilmour. Gilmoo! points to sites of Gilmour's interest and offers insight into the author, including a resume and a 
personal photo menagerie. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Why go to the trouble of Yahooing his site? "It was really just an overnight thing," Gilmour says. "I was 
procrastinating, studying for a Linear Algebra midterm, and Gilmoo! was born." (If we had to choose between coding 
and linear algebra, we'd do the same.) Online and paper magazines have covered his creation. It's also one of the sites 
featured in the Riddler scavenger hunt.<BR>
<IMG WIDTH=270 HEIGHT=45 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="art/yecch.gif" VSPACE=15 HSPACE=15>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another Yahoolian site, Yippee!, from the mind of Adam Tyner, was inspired by Yahoo!'s easy-to-navigate 
organizational structure. Overwhelmed by the amount of info in his site -- Tyner collects data on He-Man and the 
Masters of the Universe, Yoo-Hoo, and Killer Tomatoes among other wide-ranging topics -- he decided to change the 
look of his site from a straight-list format. He liked Yahoo!'s structure, "so I copied it." At press time, Tyner was now 
considering creating a mock surf shop and a Yahooligans! parody soon.<BR>
<IMG WIDTH=270 HEIGHT=54 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/yippie.gif" VSPACE=15 HSPACE=15>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, the site most closely resembling the Yahoo! searchable structure and categories is the relatively new 
Yecch!!! site, one of the many parody sites produced by Yeeeoww! Digital Lampoon master Pat Campbell. He 
attributes the entire lampooning venture to "reading too much <I>Mad</I> magazine when I was young." Yecch!!! not only 
looks like Yahoo!, but it finds the worst possible stuff on the Web and offers viewers the choice to browse around or 
search for topics of interest. Campbell adds that his team is dedicated to the site, "and take great pains to come up with 
a stinkin' Web Site o' th' day every single stinkin' day." His fine collection of Web wretchedness receives roughly 500 
hits a day. At one point, Yecch!!! was on Yahoo's cool list, but it's since been unceremoniously removed. This snub has 
stumped and angered Campbell. "Needless to say, we're gonna sue their ass," he says.
