Perhaps the general public--that great unenlightened mass to whom 
the word "wired" means "too much coffee" and <I>IU</I> connotes a 
method of birth control--thinks of the Internet as a hangout for bomb-
building, masturbating, terrorist Nazi nerds whose main source of 
income is selling animal sex videos to third graders. But once you're 
online for a while, you know that that's just silly. Those few misfits are 
far outnumbered by UFO buffs and conspiracy theorists. 
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well, maybe not too far outnumbered--but it's no revelation that the 
fringes of reason are much closer to the mainstream in the forum of the 
Internet where the parameters of acceptable debate are far broader 
than they are on, say, <I>This Week With David Brinkley</I>. At 
times, the Net seems like a big block party for anyone with a weird idea. 
Whether it's the guy selling tickets for a UFO-watching cruise to the 
South Pole (they fly out of a giant hole in the Earth there--and it's a 
steal to see at $9,999) or the guy whose Web site includes x-rays of his 
skull revealing the microwave receivers implanted in his brain, let's face 
it, the preponderance of bizarre notions is one of the most "just-plain-
fun" aspects of Internet culture. So how could anyone stoop to spoil 
this nonstop celebration of the outr&eacute;? Difficult as it is to believe, the 
Net is also home to a special breed of wet blanket: self-appointed 
guardians of reason and logic, whose main goal it is to piddle on these 
wild and wonderful theories. They call themselves "skeptics," and they 
don't want to believe. 
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Why the sudden explosion of interest, even among some otherwise 
sensible people, in all sorts of paranormal 'happenings?'" asks the 
Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal 
on its Web site (<A HREF="http://www.csicop.org">http://www.csicop.org</A>). 
"Are we in retreat from the scientific ideas of rationality, 
dispassionate examination of evidence, and sober experiment that have 
made modern civilization what it is today?"
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"In order to be a 'skeptic,' you must believe that the truth has a value 
in itself that makes it worth seeking, and that science, with all its faults, 
is a quest to separate such truth from falsehood," writes Peter Huston, 
vice president of "Inquiring Skeptics of Upper New York" in that group's 
online newsletter, "The Why Files," (<A 
HREF="http://www.rpi.edu/~sofkam/ISUNY/why-files.html">http://www.rpi.edu/ ~sofkam/ISUNY/why-files.html</A>) a 
publication named in parody of every skeptic's least favorite television 
program. 
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Forget for the moment that huge chunks of college tuition could be 
spent studying whether "dispassionate examination of evidence," "sober 
experiment," and "rationality" are in fact the building blocks of modern 
civilization--without arriving at an answer. The most damning charge 
that can be made against this type of "skepticism" is that its all-
encompassing faith in the rectitude of its own position. It sometimes 
appears that to be a qualified skeptic, one must also be a cocky little 
bugger. Telegenic skeptic James "The Amazing" Randi (<A 
HREF="http://www.randi.org">http://www.randi.org</A>), for 
example, peppers his Web site with pejorative digs such as "medieval 
thinking," "goofiness," "nonsense" and "quackery" aimed at claims of 
the paranormal. But the head of CSICOP--a group of which frequent 
talk-show guest Randi is a founding member--takes a more conciliatory 
approach.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"There are some people who are more hard-line skeptics," says Barry 
Karr, executive director of the two-decade-old CSICOP. "I think those 
people tend to be the ones who have been doing this a long time. But I 
think you have to keep an open mind and hopefully people will change 
their views based on what the evidence shows."
<BR>
<IMG WIDTH=50 HEIGHT=350 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="pretty2.gif" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As the most prominent organization in the skeptical milieu, 
CSICOP (<A 
HREF="http://www.csicop.org">http://www.csicop.org</A>), 
headquartered in the upstate New York hamlet, Amherst, leads the 
charge against the scourge of UFO witnesses, astrologers, alternative 
medicine practitioners, transcendental mediators, psychics and other 
blights upon the face of modernity. 
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The nonprofit group's own Web presence came in response to the 
preponderance of paranormalcy on the Net. 
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"We got so many calls and letters from people telling us there's so 
much of this stuff on the Net and saying, 'You've got to get on the Web, 
you've got to counter this,' that people forced us into it," Karr says. 
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
CSICOP's main weapon is its "Magazine of Science and Reason," 
<I>The Skeptical Inquirer</I>, from which several articles from each 
issue are available on the Web (<A 
HREF="http://www.csicop.org/si/">http://www.csicop.org/si/</A>). 
In the pages of <I>The Inquirer</I>, CSICOP unleashes its arsenal of 
reason against such targets as 
the alien autopsy video, Virgin Mary apparitions and--horror of horrors--
aromatherapy. ("It is not the odor that arises from these fragrances that 
is troubling, it is the stench arising from the unwarranted claims made 
about them.") 
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Perhaps sometimes we go too far and are personally nasty toward 
paranormal believers. Perhaps we sometimes are biased in the sense of 
blindness to new phenomena," admits Taner Edis, proprietor of a 
leading skeptical mailing list (skeptic-request@listproc.
hcf.jhu.edu) and keeper of the Skeptic Annotated Bibliography 
<NOBR>(<A HREF="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~edis/skeptic_biblio.html">
http://www.public.iastate.edu/</NOBR> ~edis/skeptic_biblio.html</A>). Edis, 
however, argues not that skeptics should be more open-minded, but 
that they should be more honest about admitting their prejudices, that 
they've arrived at a well-formed world view into which alien abductions 
and psychic detectives just don't fit.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"I saw various instances of skeptics behaving in irrational and 
dogmatic ways," says Jim Lippard, a veteran skeptic who became 
disillusioned with CSICOP. "A lot of skeptics don't seem to recognize 
that when they're putting forth an alternative explanation of some 
phenomenon that they have to abide by the same standards of 
evidence as everyone else. And a lot of them don't seem to recognize 
that they have to defend their views as well."
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Lippard, in addition to operating his own Web page (<A HREF="http://www.primenet.com/~lippard/">
http://www.primenet.com/~lippard/</A>) 
with one of the most thorough available 
inventories of skeptical Web links, manages the Web site for 
<I>Skeptic</I> magazine (http://www.skeptic.com). As with 
<I>SI</I>, <I>Skeptic</I>'s site offers a subscription pitch beefed 
up with just enough content from the magazine to give the site a life of 
its own.
<BR>
<IMG WIDTH=50 HEIGHT=350 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="pretty2.gif" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Published by The Skeptics' Society, <I>Skeptic</I> takes a more, 
well, reasonable approach than its rival, that "Magazine of Science and 
Reason." Skeptic's credo comes from the 17th-century philosopher 
Baruch Spinoza: "I have made a ceaseless effort not to ridicule, not to 
bewail, not to scorn human actions, but to understand them." 
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As opposed to the self-assured and somewhat glib tenor of 
<I>Skeptical Inquirer</I> and the outright sneering found on Randi's 
site, <I>Skeptic</I> offers a rational view of rationality. 
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Ideally, skeptics do not go into an investigation closed to the 
possibility that a phenomenon might be real or that a claimant might be 
right," say the editors of <I>Skeptic</I> on their site. "When we say 
we are ëskeptical' we mean that we must see evidence before we 
believe. Skeptics are from Missouri--the <I>Show Me</I> State." 
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
According to Karr, however, this view doesn't differ much from his 
own position. Karr is quick to point out that CSICOP, for example, is "a 
group of individuals," not an organization with a platform to which all 
members must adhere.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"It's possible that there's life out there or even that UFOs are visiting 
our planet," Karr says. "But it's a question of evidence."
<BR>
<IMG WIDTH=70 HEIGHT=200 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="pretty1.gif" HSPACE=4 VSPACE=4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I>Skeptic</I> also ranges over broader and frequently more 
important subject matter than does its CSICOP-published counterpart. 
While SI keeps busy hammering away at wacky and generally harmless 
opponents (the latest issue posted on the <I>SI</I> site devotes a 
good-size article to debunking photographs of ghosts), 
<I>Skeptic</I>'s recent issues have examined: the "Bell Curve" 
debate over the inheritability of intelligence, whether the HIV virus is the 
actual cause of AIDS, Holocaust "revisionism" and recovered memory 
therapy. 
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"We were founded to look at claims of the paranormal," Karr 
counters. "We don't claim to be a social commentary magazine like 
<I>Skeptic</I>  is. We don't claim to investigate everything."
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nonetheless, <I>Skeptical Inquirer</I> has a long-standing 
committee to probe non-traditional health claims (hence the critique of 
aromatherapy), and has also taken on such topics as evolutionary 
theory and the claims of Satanic cult "survivors." The 
September/October, 1996 issue features an article, available on the 
Web, entitled "Conspiracy Theories and Paranoia: Notes From a Mind 
Control Conference" which critiques not only conspiratorial thinking but 
also the aforementioned "recovered memory therapy" (i.e.,  the 
recollection of allegedly 
suppressed childhood sex-abuse memories at the prompting of 
psychologists; see the False Memory Syndrome Foundation Web site at 
<A HREF="http://iquest.com/~fitz/fmsf/">http://iquest.com/~fitz/fmsf/</A> 
for coverage of the issue). 
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
CSICOP's coverage of conspiracy theories helps fill a gap in the 
oeuvre of party-pooping Web sites. While there are dozens of skeptical 
sites--mostly sites put up by regional skeptic groups--there are a few 
devoted to debunking conspiracy theories.
<BR>
<IMG WIDTH=50 HEIGHT=350 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="pretty2.gif" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of course, there are many devoted to advocating conspiracy theories 
of every stripe, but 50-year-old Marquette University political science 
professor John McAdams seems like a lone 
nut himself with his Kennedy Assassination Home Page 
(<A HREF="http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/">http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/</A>), 
arguing that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But while CSICOP deals primarily with matters that can, or should be 
able to be tested by scientific procedures, the murky shrouds of history 
leave the assassination of President John F. Kennedy (as well as many 
similar conspiracy theories) more ambiguous.  McAdams, who teaches 
a course on the JFK assassination, says there are skeptical protocols 
even in that case.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"If people on opposing sides of the issue can come up with theories 
that fit the evidence, then the question is how do you choose between 
two competing theories. The classic social science theory is very 
straightforward: parsimony. You favor the simplest theory."
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Scroll through postings to 
the newsgroups alt.conspiracy or alt.conspiracy.jfk for even five 
minutes, and it quickly becomes evident that parsimony is not a strong 
point of online conspiracy theory. Nor for that matter does it seem likely 
that skeptics will ever outnumber UFO believers and connoisseurs of the 
paranormal on the Net. Their online presence is small but at least it 
shows that the Net, like most UFO reports and Bigfoot sightings, leaves 
plenty of room for doubt.
