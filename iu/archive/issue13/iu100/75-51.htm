Donna Rice Hughes, best known as the seductress who sunk Gary 
Hart's 1988 presidential campaign, resurfaced this year as 
communications director for "Enough is Enough," an anti-porn group 
that, beside having a name that recalls a Dick Van Patten sitcom, 
targeted the Internet.

Considering how hotly debated the issue of online pornography has 
become, an anonymous government worker's nomination of Traci Lords 
for Congress made complete sense in 1996. The campaign Web

Please Come to Boston
</B><BR></FONT><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">
After meeting his dream girl in a chat room, a 15-year-old Illinois boy 
hopped on his bike to visit her--in Boston. Soon realizing that the 
1,000-some mile bike ride might be impractical, he decided to take 
buses instead. After two days on the road, the boy walked 20 miles 
from a bus terminal to the girl's house, almost. Police stopped the boy 
a block from the girls house and the boy was returned home to his 
parents without ever seeing the girl. Asked about the young Romeo' trip 
afterward, the would-be Juliet said "I was really shocked. I thought 'He 
must be psycho.'"

Before Fox released its "Alien Autopsy: Fact or Fiction?" television 
special, netizens were hard at work, scrutinizing alien autopsy footage

officials sought out the truth. Thankfully, the Committee for the 
Scientific Investigation of Claims set the record straight--the Internet 
footage is fraudulent. Really?

The Slow Death of iGuide 
</B><BR></FONT><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">
At the start of the year Delphi, or iGuide as it was soon ot be redubbed, 
was set to re-debut as a now well-financed challenger to AOL backed by 
communication heavyweights MCI and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. By 
the end of the year iGuide was little more than a glorified online version 
of TV Guide. Media junkies and Murdoch bashers got a kick out of 
watching the ill-fated venture slowly hemorrhage. Some of the 
highlights:
</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="arial, helvetica">
<UL>
<LI>2/02-The partnership between MCI and News Corp. ends as MCI 
announces it will team with Microsoft on competing products.
<LI>2/08-189 people are laid off before the public debut of the site/service.
<LI>3/04-Two top managers bail out.
<LI>3/06-iGuide allegedly receives between 500,000 and 600,000 hits 
daily
<LI>5/01-Murdoch sells Delphi back to its original owners. Those owners 
inherit a service now boasting some 50,000 members. 
<LI>7/09- iGuide sells its customer-support center and Internet network 
infrastructure.
<LI>7/31-A spokesperson says iGuide will shift its focus from Web site 
reviews to Internet-based content more closely tied to News Corp. 
properties. A dozen more layoffs of site reviewers are planned.

The McSpotlight

<IMG WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=72 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="53.gif" VSPACE=3 HSPACE=3 ALT="McCrap">
<FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">
McDonald's got McScrewed by the Net in 1996, as the press gave 
more and more media attention to the McSpotlight Web page and the 
McLibel mailing list. The site and list were initiated to galvanize anti-
McDonald's sentiment on the Net, particularly in response to the 
company's suit against two Brits, Dave Morris and Helen Steel. 
McDonald's filed a lawsuit against the pair in 1990 for libeling the 
company via pamphlets they released in the U.K.. The pamphlets 
charged the food chain with exploitative labor practices and animal 
cruelty, among other things. This grassroots movement proved that the 
Net is mightier than the sword, the pen and the Big Mac himself.

last December, teenagers from the hoity-toity Chicago suburb of Lake Forest Ill., were charged with creating and passing counterfeit $20 bills in a Kenosha, Wisc., Taco Bell. 
The teens said they had gotten the idea, which involved a copying machine, tea bags, lemon-lime flavored drink mix and a microwave oven, off the Internet. Shocked high school officials said that the students couldn't have 
learned such a thing on the school computers due to usage restrictions, but promised to "take all security precautions one can take, <I>vis a vis</I> technology, to screen out any objectionable or inappropriate materials."

<FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">
The World Wide Web Consortium, with 22 industry organizations, 
authored the Platform for Internet Content (PICS), a labeling protocol 
that essentially allows users to create their own rating systems for the 
Web. The PICS standard boasts "self-regulation," yet it still concerns 
many users who believe it's just one more step toward Net censorship. 
Let's face it, with or without PICS, Congress'  porn-bustin' cronies are 
going to try to censor the Net. Sen. Exon can hardly grasp the Net as a 
concept--is he really going to comprehend and embrace something
