Fear and Loathing in Lexis-Nexis
</B><BR></FONT>
<FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">
This summer, word started getting around that Lexis-Nexis was re-selling 
access to a sophisticated database of personal information, called P-
Trak. A spark of concern turned into a bonfire of bad P.R. all around. 
The grass-roots movement against the P-Trak database was significant, 
and spoke well for the responsibility of Netizens. However, some facts 
(about SSN and mother's maiden name) got overzealously distorted, 
and the story started to balloon out of control. Netizens came out 
looking jerky, P-Trak looked maligned, but the matter that's at the heart 
of it all is that collecting and connecting publicly-available data creates 
new risks for privacy.

The Sincerest Form of Flattery...

<FONT FACE="arial, helvetica"><BR>
...is outright plagiarism. In March, Hotwired publicly accused c|net of 
stealing the wording of their help pages. Says Flux's Ned Brainard, 
"Note the order of questions. Note the wording of questions. Heck, note 
the text itself, starting with the very first question. Apparently the staff at 
c|net has found that the ÎSave as Source' command on their browsers 
is the perfect tool to express flattery in the time-honored form of 
scrupulous imitation."

AOL was blamed for a lot of things in the Internet community, but

From what rock did these guys crawl out from under? They claim to own 
a patent (#4,528,643) that represents much of today's electronic 
commerce over the Web. So far, e-Data has sent out 25,000 amnesty 
packets to companies they say are violating their patent. If you're selling 
goods over the Net, you too may be slapped with an e-Data lawsuit. 
Following e-Data's lead, <I>IU</I> has patented a system that represents the

Suck Sells Out

<FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">
When the sucksters sold their site to Hotwired in late '95, we quietly 
waited for the site to become a mouthpiece of the man. When version 
2.0 debuted in early May, complete with frames and Java-enhanced, 
browser-crashing ads, we knew the end was near. When, Wired, Rolling 
Stone and Time, ran pictures of suck co-creator Carl Steadman in the 
same month, we thought this is it. Well, were still waiting.

Anonymous? Yeah, Right...
</B><BR></FONT><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">
Paranoid security freaks have long hypothesized that the Feds don't 
really need to bother with search warrants and code-cracking; the 
surest way to read secret e-mail would be to infiltrate the anonymous-
remailing community and trick users into routing e-mail through 
government machines. In April, this urban legend took on respectability 
when, for the first time, it was discussed by security professionals at a 
Harvard symposium. Be safe, kids; encryption is to e-mail what 
condoms are to sex.

CompuServe removed over 200 Usenet newsgroups from their service 
earlier this year, including a number of forums involving discussion 
about homosexuality. CompuServe flip flopped once again their after 
receiving negative media publicity and tons of complaints from the 
service's users. They brought back all but seven newsgroups:  
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.pre-teen, alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.young, 
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen.male, alt.sex.bestiality, 
alt.sex.pedophilia.pictures, alt.sex.pedophilia.girls and

Silly Law Suits
</B><BR></FONT><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">
Where's there's money, there's potential law suits to file, and this year 
the Internet became the arena of choice for enterprising lawyers looking 
to further bog down the justice system. Our vote for the silliest: Texas 
baker Miss King's Kitchens, maker of the "Original Texas YA-HOO! 
Cake," sued Yahoo! over their shared moniker. It seems the bakery first 
became alerted to the problem when several customers complained 
that their delicious baked goods yielded no results for even the simplest 
of searches. Anxiously awaiting the results of the trial are the makers of 
Lysol Disinfectant and Spiderman, the original Webcrawler.

The Software Publishers' Association officially began its crackdown of

when the SPA started charging ISPs as accessories to piracy and
