<FONT SIZE=5 FACE="arial, helvetica"><B>1996.</B></FONT><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica"> It's finally almost over. Excuse us while we try to catch our 
collective breath. It's been an amazing year on the Internet. And we've 
had an incredible time trying to cover it all. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Internet was everywhere, far and near, high and low. Every other 
TV commercial had a URL tacked on the end. Both comic heroine Cathy 
and <I>Friends'</I> Chandler found love online. Story-thirsty local TV 
newscasters played up sensational tales of online abductions. Magazine 
racks were stuffed to the gills with new Net publications. Stock racers 
had URLs printed on their spoilers. The Net even became a campaign 
issue. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There's really nothing like working a 12-hour day, covering nothing 
but the Internet, and then coming home only to be bombarded with 
reminders of it everywhere. It's like the old adage about working 
in a whorehouse (pardon the crude, but accurate analogy): sometimes 
it's hard to get excited. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This was the year that Bill Gates finally realized this Internet thing 
wasn't going to go away, and so decided that he might as well own it, 
too. Hell, he even took one of our editors. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And the hype. Every day there was a new 
product/site that was going to revolutionize the way the world spun.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One thing this year taught us is, don't believe the hype. Oh, don't get 
us wrong, we still believe the Internet is a wondrous place. But it's still 
about 10/90 proposition. Little wheat, mostly chaff. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When there were only a few thousand sites on the Web, it was much 
easier to collect the wheat to make cut-and-dry editorial decisions. 
Nowadays, with thousands of new sites a day, and hundreds of product 
announcements and strategic alliances a week, we have trouble even 
finding the wheat, let alone gathering enough to make a bread stick. Do 
you follow?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Still, there's the nagging question of how to round-up the year, for 
you, the loyal reader. Working off of an outdated story line-up lurking in 
the bowels of our server, our art director went ahead months ago and 
commissioned the <I>IU</I> 100 trophy seen replicated on our cover 
and (above). So we knew we had to pick 100 something, 
but what? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We thought about the 100 best sites on the Web, but that seemed 
too pedestrian. Then we considered the 100 most influential people on 
the Net? That idea sounded like a sure cure for insomnia. We also 
tossed around the idea of leaving the pages blank as some sort of 
pretentious protest for some unknown cause. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then it dawned on us, why not make the <I>IU</I> 100 a round-up 
of the most Notorious, Ridiculous, Infamous, Ludicrous, Outrageous, 
Egregious (think we used the Thesaurus feature in Word?) Humorous, 
Scandalous and Plain Old Wacky Events, Issues, People, Sites and 
Trends on the Internet in 1996?
