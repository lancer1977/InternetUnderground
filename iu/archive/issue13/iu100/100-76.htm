The comics section of the newspaper was invaded by cyberspace as

It's no surprise that a video tape named "Playboy's Girls of the Internet" 
would sell like buckets of ice in the Sonoran. What is surprising is that 
people tuned into the video's March kickoff party broadcast sponsored 
by AudioNet. The tech conversations were largely upstaged by 
shameless self-promotion, meretricious complimenting from the 
interviewer and gratuitous squeaks and giggles.

Politician's Internet Gaffes
</B><BR></FONT><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">
Inevitably, whenever politicians open their mouths to 
talk about the Internet, they say something silly (Sen. Pat Leahy and 
Rep. Rick White excluded). Our favorite line this year was Bob Dole's 
stilted reading of his Web address 
during the closing remarks of the first presidential debate. Dole forgot to 
note the "dot" between "dolekemp96" and "org," an honest, yet funny 
mistake. Second place 
goes to President Clinton for asking Vice President Gore 
why some links were highlighted blue when the two were surfing the Net 
during a photo-op.

Ed Cummings, a.k.a. Bernie S., spent nearly two years in prison--five 
different prisons really--after being found guilty to the strained charge 
of intent to commit telecommunications fraud. Cummings' crime, 
equivalent in severity to littering and insulting the flag (by Philadelphia 
legal standards), led to a nightmarish journey through the prison system 
that would have had Franz Kafka shaking his head in amazement.

Boors on the Web

Last year, Robert Toups went to bat against <I>Internet 
Underground</I> on behalf of his Web site, Babes on the Web. 
<I>IU</I> had criticized the boorish and gender-stereotyping media 
prank, then offered "Toupsie" a chance to rebut in print. Toupsie's 
rebuttal rivaled the original piece in length, and he wouldn't hear of 
having it edited. A spat ensued, he never wrote to word count, and his 
arrogant ramblings never saw the light of day, except on his own Web 
site. Oddly enough, Toupsie two-facedly bashed the magazine in public, 
but his private e-mails to staffers complimented the publication. Then 
the lawyers got involved--Anyway, at press time, his site hadn't been 
updated in eight months, and that's as good as dead on the Web.
