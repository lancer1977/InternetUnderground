The Rimm Porn Study '96
</B><BR></FONT>
<FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">
In February, U.S. Department of Justice attorneys slid to a new ethical 
low when they filed a debunked and deceptive cyberporn study as 
evidence of smut on the Net in the Communications Decency Act 
lawsuit. Perhaps they forgot that lawyers are barred from submitting 
misleading
documents to a court. The research paper by former Carnegie Mellon 
University undergraduate
Marty Rimm had appeared on the cover of the July 4, 1995 TIME 
Magazine, which Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) waved on the Senate 
floor as justification for Internet censorship. It might have worked, 
except for the efforts of academics, reporters and lawyers on the WELL 
conferencing system who exposed Rimm's dubious claims and unethical 
"research" practices. However, since Carnegie Mellon administrators 
endorsed Rimm's study, they continue to stonewall any internal 
investigation of its many disturbing ethical violations.

Hoarding Domain Names

Throughout the year, we waited on the edge of our chairs to see the 
fruits of Procter & Gamble's domain-name-grabbing spree of 1995. The 
company, makers of a wide range of hygiene products, seized names 
for said products, then went on to claim names for dozens of 
embarrassing afflictions...including pimples.com, dandruff.com and 
diarrhea.com. To date, they've only colonized a few of the sites; most 
just send you back to the company home page.

What started in 1995 as a good joke when hackers marred a Web site

this year as unknown hackers defaced the home pages of the Dept. of 
Justice and the C.I.A. (cleverly renaming the organization the "Central 
Stupid Agency"). Other victims included the Nation of Islam and security 
expert Tsutomu Shimomura. In early October President 
Clinton signed the The National Information Infrastructure Protection Act

Beloved anon.penet.fi, oh how thou hast been violated. On August 30, 
frustrated by the Finnish court's insistence that the anonymous

Although PGP and other powerful encryption technologies (technologies 
that privatize forms of electronic communication) are already in the

In June, InterNIC made good on its threat to shut down over 9,000

Pretty Good Privacy

<FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">
Hallelujah! January 11, 1996, marked the end of the ridiculous three-
year long government investigation of Phil Zimmermann, the author of 
Pretty Good Privacy encryption software. With little explanation and 
much embarrassment, the Feds decided not to indict the beleaguered 
software-consultant-cum-hero on criminal charges of "exporting 
munitions" when PGP was published on the Net, and the cat was let 
out the bag on FTP servers around the world. To this day, Zimmermann 
is a poster child for privacy rights, and  PGP's dual key system ensures 
strong and simple cryptography for the average citizen.

After all the fanfare died down, Web users realized that Microsoft's 
Slate was nothing more than a traditional newsstand magazine 
formatted in HTML. Readers rejected the idea of paying for it--but don't 
think that'll stop Slate from making its way into your home. As 
Stale.com, a brilliant parody of the Michael Kinsley-edited publication, 
explained, "You will read it because it demands to be read. Ignore us 
now, but sooner or later, [Slate] will be bundled into your operating 
system and you'll have no choice."

Bowing to arguments from the late French president's wife, a Parisian 
court on Jan. 17 banned a tell-all book penned by Francois Mitterrand's 
longtime personal physician. But by the time the court acted, 40,000 
copies of  "Le Grand Secret" already had been sold. One delighted 
reader, after devouring the intimate details of his former leader's bout 
with prostate cancer, decided to scan in the pages and use the 
accompanying publicity to hype his "cyber-cafi." He was later arrested--
ostensibly on unrelated charges.

1996 was the year that the Net community slapped itself on the 
forehead with a vengeance. Posts to newsgroups usually expire within a 
week or two, and netizens have long assumed that their childish flames

However, Deja News, the largest Usenet archive in existence, provides 
posts back to May 1995, and the service will soon archive back to 
1979. Privacy forums boiled over with indignation throughout the year 
as people fumed about this "invasion" of privacy--often prompting the 
response, "Well, if you didn't want people to read it, why'd you post it to 
a worldwide network of computers?"

Scientologists have been up in arms ever since a mysterious user,

after another, the Church has locked horns with a number of ISPs and 
operators of anonymous remailers in an attempt to disclose the true 
name of the culprit. Despite any hard evidence, the Church has picked 
on netizen Grady Ward for the violation. Backed by thousands of other 
netizens, Ward and anti-Church activists have retaliated in kind, filing 
million dollar counterclaims, and  posting site after site exposing 
Scientology scandals and bullying tactics. The battle dates back to 
a.r.s.' beginnings in 1991, but has never been more hard fought than in 
1996. And 1997 looks to be as bloody.

The Net Stinks of IPO

Wall Street's love affair with the Net resulted in a lot heartbreak in 
1996. With horseblinders on, investors madly sought out and gobbled 
up Internet stocks as though there were no tomorrow. In late 1995, 
Netscape set the pace with its initial public offering at a price of $28 a 
share. Two months later, the stock rocketed to $150 a share, and later 
split 2-for-1 (and hit a 52 week low of $32.13 a share). Following its 
lead, a slew of other tech companies went public, most of them young, 
overvalued and deep in the red. Even Wired Ventures took a disastrous 
shot at going public--arrogantly valuing itself at $447 million (while 
losing and estimated $12 million annually), this was one of the few 
tech stocks Wall Street actually balked at.

Ignore the cola wars, Coke vs. Pepsi and the burger wars, McDonalds

installment of the consumer products battle trilogy, the Browser Wars, 
Netscape vs. Microsoft. Time was that Netscape Navigator ruled the 
browser market. Riding high on the millions earned from their lucrative 
IPO and enjoying a virtual monopoly (the AOL Browser? Please), the Jim 
and Marc show was the toast of the town. Then Bill stepped up to the 
plate. The first version of the Explorer browser reeked, but Gates and 
Co. retreated, retooled, and by the time 3.0 was released, Microsoft 
had created a virtual copy of Navigator (just as Window 95 aped the 
Mac OS). Internet magazines ran elaborate cover stories reporting 
breathlessly from the front lines of this virtual war. With virtually 
identical products--the major difference being whether you like 
watching an asteroid war behind a giant monolithic "N" or a single 
meteorite orbiting a half globe/half  "e" as you twiddled your thumbs 
waiting for that 56k site map to squeeze itself through your 14.4 
modem--the two mortal enemies turned to content alliances to lure 
customers. Now with both companies feverishly pushing 4.0 versions to 
the market, its time for us to let them in on a little secret--the winner 
will be the one that continues to give it away for free. As long as their 
both free, users will just grab which ever icon is more convenient to 
double click on. And while these two behemoths continue to battle it 
out to see who will take Browser of the Year honors at next year's gala 
C/Net Awards, we'll be sitting on the sidelines sipping a cold RC, eating 
a Wendy's burger and rooting for Lynx.

February 8, 1996, or Black Tuesday--it was the day President Clinton 
signed the loathed Communications Decency Act into law. Rather than 
sit on their hands, the Net sprung into action and took the U.S. 
Government to task. Challenging the constitutionality of the law, the 
Electronic Frontier Foundation, with the American Civil Liberties Union 
and 18 other plaintiffs, filed suit on February 26. The world turned their 
Web pages black in protest and thus began the massive Blue Ribbon 
campaign to halt American censorship of the Net. It was not all for 
naught. On June 12, a three judge panel in Philadelphia ruled the CDA 
in violation of rights protected by the First and Fifth Amendment, and 
thus, unconstitutional. The Government responded by filing a Notice of 
Appeal on July 1. And then a second challenge to the Act, filed by the 
online newspaper, The American Reporter, also found the CDA in 
violation of the First Amendment on July 29. The one-two punch! All 
suing parties will consolidated as the case heads to the Supreme Court 
for one last cage-match brawl, where only one person will be left 
standing. Stay tuned.
