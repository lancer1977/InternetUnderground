<B>Denise might be a good deal.</B> An athletic- looking Berlin native, she specializes 
in massage, safe sex and "Vibratorspiele." 
<A HREF="http://www.rising-sun.com">Her home page</A> lists a phone number with the assurance "English spoken." Too 
bad Berlin's so far away.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Resources such as these are the wet-dream nightmares of those who would 
mold America's moral character through legislation. As if JPEG porn, chat-room 
orgies and lurid CD-ROM ads weren't enough to tempt Junior off the straight and 
narrow, the Web now offers ladies for rent around the world. Yahoo!, for 
example, lists over three dozen escort services, mostly in the United States. 
Individual offers can be found on Usenet sex groups, albeit through a haze of 
phone-sex ads. Sometimes it seems as if plug-in sex toy VR interfaces, payable 
through First Virtual accounts, are next. It's enough to make your average parent 
think that maybe Sen. Exon had something going there after all.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Net's perspective on sex for sale mostly comes down to the question of 
how soon you can get it for how much. Most Net users still log on for either long 
nights of caffeine-inspired clicking or some lunch-time quickie-surfs behind the 
boss' back. This leaves little time for foreplay. Convenience is key: the first Net 
prostitute resources were designed to help get the potential customer laid as 
effortlessly as possible. Most famous, perhaps, is the <A HREF="http://www.paranoia.com/faq/prostitution/">World Sex Guide</A> founded 
on posts to the Usenet newsgroup alt.sex.prostitution. In a show of 
consumer empowerment, johns report their experiences with prostitutes around 
the world, describe which ladies' services they preferred and issue warnings to 
each other. Elsewhere in the alt.sex groups, 
massive pro-prostitution cross-posts incite flame-wars as vicious as 
vice-sweeps. One of several pro-prostitution Usenet spammers, Dave Hutchison 
of <A HREF="mailto:davephx@primenet.com">Liberated Christians</A>, takes great care to emphasize prostitution as morally 
uplifting. "Sex workers could be a vital source of healing by teaching and letting 
people experience different sexual and intimacy skills with a variety of people," 
he says, after decrying prostitution by force or by minors. In a 
Net where the pedophiliac rape fantasies of alt.sex.stories co-exist with Usenet-
wide racial hate trolls, the relatively victimless crime of prostitution seems 
innocuous.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That quality has led to a subtle shift in the way the Net encourages us to think 
about prostitution. Some of the newer resources treat prostitutes as human 
beings, not mere objects of barter. The lone goof or indignant moralist scouring 
the Web for hookers is likely to run across the <A HREF="http://www.creative.net/~penet/">Prostitute's Education Network</A> 
(PENet). Overseen by the vibrant "Scarlot Harlot," a.k.a. Carol Leigh, an 
abundant cheery-faced prostitute and activist who believes in the power of art to 
change people's minds, this site is dedicated to providing "information for sex 
workers and activists/educators who study issues of decriminalization, human 
rights in the context of prostitution, violence against prostitutes and women, sex 
workers and pornography, as well as current trends in legislation and social 
policy in the U.S. and internationally." 
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Leigh says that she believes the most effective part of the PENet site is its 
resources for students writing about the issue: "A real reading of the site would 
help students (our future leaders) understand that prostitutes are individuals like 
them, with thoughts and feelings...that we are more than the stereotypes. My 
hope is that some may understand that our rights are seriously violated on an 
ongoing basis."
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Two of the top-billed items on the PENet site are in fact 
the "Student Resources" and the "Health and Community Needs Assessments 
and Services" sections. These offer a list of suggested readings, an introduction 
to the concepts of legalizing and decriminalizing 
various aspects of the sex trade, a page of statistics, several files on prostitutes 
and law enforcement, and a summary of health service needs reports. 
Realistically, of course, the curious young researcher is more likely to be drawn 
to the essays with juicier titles, such as "Working in the Nevada Brothels," 
"Thoroughly Modern Madam" and "Don't Swear. Don't Slouch. When in Doubt, 
Smile." But as it turns 
out, those particular essays are about 
the injustices of the Nevada 
system, the managerial problems of running a brothel and the legal 
difference between lap-dancers and showgirls. 
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
None of this is calculated to arouse lecherous interests. In fact, the closest 
that PENet comes to offering the lurid scenes of sex-for-money is a description 
of a police bust: "He grabs me. Since I did not get a clear look at any type of 
badge, I got scared and I thought I was going to be raped and robbed...I tried to 
get away but he grabbed me by my hair and slammed me against a brick 
building wall."
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Almost every day I say my mantras," Leigh says. "LAWS THAT PUNISH 
PROSTITUTES ARE CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN and THE ARREST 
AND INSTITUTIONALIZED HARASSMENT 
OF PROSTITUTES ARE ATROCITIES." Apparently she is not alone in her beliefs: The 
PENet site provides information from and about organizations such as PONY 
("Prostitutes of New York"), the Exotic Dancer's Alliance and <A HREF="http://www.coyotesea.org/">COYOTE</A> ("Cast Off 
Your Old Tired Ethics"). <A HREF="http://www.walnet.org/swav/">The Sex Worker's Alliance of Vancouver</A> celebrates 
sexuality in its own way, with a dominatrix cartoon splashed on its main page 
and an archive of news, information and resources second only to PENet's. 
COYOTE in Seattle has a similarly ambitious site in progress. "As long as the 
sex worker and client have a mutually respectful business relationship and no 
one is stealing, cheating, assaulting, et al, the other, what's the problem?" asks 
COYOTE-Seattle executive director Catherine La Croix. "Why is it illegal to 
charge for what can be freely dispensed? Sex work is no more moral or immoral 
than the chocolate or distilling industries."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The world as a whole tends to disagree. Reports and essays from Off-Net 
media sources that have been transferred to the Web tend to focus on the 
dangers of exploitation and abuse. Some of the most vivid imagery is found in 
Andrea Dworkin's writings, which warn about abstracting the realities 
of prostitution, and the far-left 
magazine <A HREF="http://www.echonyc.com/~onissues/s96orgasm.html"><I>On the Issues</I></A>, which decries prostitution as a damaging model 
for sex. 
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is not to say that the prostitute activists deny the dangers of prostitution; 
this is, it would seem, why they spread information and debate rather than GIFs 
and sex 
stories. The World Charter for Prostitutes' Rights on PENet's site calls for an end 
to  "fraud, coercion, violence, child sexual abuse, child labor, rape [and] racism" 
in the context of decriminalized prostitution. Elsewhere, these resources deal 
with the dangers of trafficking, the vulnerability of the prostitute and the need for 
more safe-sex awareness. And there is always the conviction, among the happy-
hooker graphics and the off-hand sex-talk, that when prostitutes aren't being 
exploited they truly are doing nothing wrong.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When exploitation occurs, however, it is not treated lightly. The 
horrors of child prostitution have inspired a host of sites: <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/dbtlori/dbt1.htm">Don't! Buy! Thai!</A> 
organizes a boycott of goods from Thailand in response to abuses there; <A HREF="http://www.billboards.com/billboards/tsv/wakeup.htm">The 
Survivor's Voice</A> supports the boycott and gives readers a chance to sign a 
petition online. The Thailand-based <A HREF="http://ksc.goldsite.com/capcat/">Coalition Against Prostitution and Child 
Abuse in Thailand</A> is dedicated to the "Thai volunteers, educators, social service 
workers, law enforcement personnel and government workers who are 
sacrificing on a daily basis to help the young people of Thailand," but disagrees 
with the boycott approach. Organizations around the world such as the <A HREF="http://www.pristine.com.tw/WRF/wrf.html">Taipei 
Women's Rescue Foundation</A> advertise similar efforts. This is global education at 
its finest. 
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Net-na&iuml;ve may be unable to distinguish between sexploitation and 
education, but there is a feeling among the latter that they're on a mission. "Most 
other [sex-related] sites are crap," says Atta of the World Sex Guide. "Low quality 
photos, phone sex ads and a monthly fee and no genuine information. That 
sucks. My site is completely free, lives on contributions from readers and 
contains no commercial messages whatsoever. That's how the Internet was 
meant to operate."
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Other prostitution advocates concur. "Some [sex-related stuff online] is done 
responsibly and professionally. Most, I would say, and I've been online for nearly 
10 years," says La Croix of COYOTE-Seattle.  "Of course, there are always 
the sleazy schlockmeisters hanging around but, again, no one's forcing anyone 
to view adult material and most adult sites have rather large warnings as to 
content. Half of my clients come from the Net, and I have yet to encounter an 
adolescent boy." And Leigh of PENet expresses astonishment that anyone 
would choose a computer over a real-life encounter, joking, "I still can't figure out 
who sits in front of their computer diddling themselves looking at low res GIFs." 
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Judging from the traffic in the binaries' groups, it would seem that self-diddlers 
make up a large and lusty share of Net users, and the market has not been slow 
to respond. Usenet's alt.sex.prostitution, along with many of the other alt.sex 
groups, is regularly flooded 
with explicit advertisements from 
porntrepeneurs. The spread of pornography has dominated the political and 
public perception of the Internet's sex-related resources, threatening to engulf 
even the most constructive voices in a tide of 
righteousness and hysteria.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Economics and sex are two of the Net's greatest concerns, and prostitution 
issues, straddling the two, are a potentially volatile area. But the human sex drive 
is as resilient as the Net itself; the lusty young male determined to score will 
inevitably find a way to do so. It could be that in the coming years accessing 
information about prostitutes' health and legal issues will be as shady as 
accessing prostitutes themselves. But regardless of whether or not we 
have the intelligence to distinguish between the two, one thing is certain: No 
matter how hard the job or how dire the threats, there will always be people 
somewhere in the world willing to sell their bodies and share their stories.
