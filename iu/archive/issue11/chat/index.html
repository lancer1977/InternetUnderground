That seems to sum up the message to Internet users in some of the stories 
circulating from the media. Oh, it 
may be all right to hit AltaVista for a search on ferrets, or to send 
e-mail to your mom. But users who connect up to interact with each other 
via IRC, online services or Web chat 
rooms seem to be suspected of using their modems only for sending smutty 
pictures to one another, and 
perhaps to hapless 6-year-olds for good measure. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And if Net chat participants aren't porn-peddling pedophiles, they're 
"addicts" who've somehow fallen into 
the sad delusion that an inanimate computer can be a source of 
companionship and caring. The unappealing 
image is  of a bunch of computer nerds, fearful of rejection in the "real" 
world, fumbling at their keyboards for 
some approximation of human interaction.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Indeed, Bill Gates, everyone's least-favorite bespectacled dweeb, enthused 
about the Net as a gathering-
place when he went on <I>David</I> Letterman. "Ah-huh," said Dave. "And would 
that be in the Pathetic Losers' 
Chat Room?"
<BR>
<IMG WIDTH=81 HEIGHT=81 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="dot.gif" HSPACE=3 VSPACE=3 ALT="dot">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Maybe so, if you imagine that everyone who chats 
on the Internet is kinda like 
Bill without the billions. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jan Fernback, a doctoral candidate at the Univer-sity of Colorado whose 
dissertation focuses on "cyber-
socialization," doesn't think they are.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"People who go on chat lines may actually be more social than some 
others," she says, contrasting chat to 
Usenet groups, where participants have a chance to think carefully about 
what to say.  "In real-time chat, you 
have to be on the ball--it goes against the myth that these people are really 
socially awkward."
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So just who are these people, and what do they get out of the chat 
experience?

Aleister, a 38-year-old New Yorker, thinks that the opportunities for 
socializing in "real time" (that is, away 
from chat--usually abbreviated to "RT") are insufficient for most people. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"If it's an addiction, it's an addiction to companionship and friendship," he 
says.  One of the advantages he 
thinks chatting has over, shall we say, 3-D interactions, is that it removes 
restrictions on what people can talk 
about. In chat rooms, where the participants are anonymous and the 
discussion covers taboo topics from sex to 
religion, people feel free to talk "honestly and revealingly. For most of us, 
the opportunity to have that kind of 
dialogue left after we left college." 
<BR>
<IMG WIDTH=81 HEIGHT=81 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="dot.gif" HSPACE=3 VSPACE=3 ALT="dot">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the grown-up world, he points out, "there's a certain face you have to 
keep in the work force." And even 
outside of work, not everyone has opportunities to make lots of friends. 
"Most people don't pick their 
neighbors.  And if you happen not to like yours, it's not like you can knock 
on the door the next day and hope 
there's someone different there."  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the Net, by contrast, there always is someone different there: Chat users 
can reach out far beyond their 
immediate surroundings to find like-minded people. Across the globe, 
Sparaxis, a South African journalist, 
seconds the sentiment.  "It's one of the great advantages cities have over 
towns," she says. "There are more 
people, therefore more people who might be family. And now...well, there 
is an entire planet full of people to 
discover. Of course the cyberplanet is dominated by North Americans and 
Scandinavians, so one can't be too 
dewy-eyed about the possibilities of world peace suddenly breaking out, but 
still."
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Still, there are 
meaningful relationships formed this way, or 
so Aleister emphatically proclaims.
<BR>
<IMG WIDTH=81 HEIGHT=81 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="dot.gif" HSPACE=3 VSPACE=3 ALT="dot">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"People's feelings are real, no matter what the cause of them--whether the 
person they love is standing in 
flesh and blood before them, or thousands of miles away on the other end of 
a network connection." He 
believes enough  in the veracity of this Net-assisted bonding  that he acted 
as the officiant at an online wedding 
ceremony last year, in which two women who had never met in person 
exchanged vows in cyberspace.   Since 
then, the practice of staging virtual weddings--complete with invitations, 
ceremonies and cyber-champagne for 
the celebrants--has caught on at some chat sites.  "I've had a couple of 
other requests to do weddings, just 
haven't been able to find the time. One woman even offered to pay a fee," 
he recounts, amused.  "But of 
course, I told her I don't do this for money!"
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And then there are those who do. Daniel Jamal, author of <I>Online Marketing 
Handbook</I> and <I>101 Businesses 
You Can Start on the Internet</I> (Van Nostrand Reinhold), has been a sysop 
for CompuServe's forum on public 
relations for 10 years. He's enthusiastic about the benefits such specialized 
chat rooms can have for 
professionals:  "People can network, make contacts, get ideas on pricing--
what they should charge clients, 
what they should pay freelancers, how to write contracts. I've heard about 
new trends and developments I 
wouldn't have found otherwise." 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It seems to be chat as ersatz social life, however, that attracts the most 
participants, whether they use the 
Net or online services.  Jamal, who was on the public relations team that 
launched America Online, recalls how 
AOL chairman Steve Case came up with the idea of calling the online 
service's 
customers "members" (as opposed to the coldly impersonal "users" or 
"subscribers"). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"It makes it sound like a club," he says. "Just a little paradigm shift, 
reframing, but it makes all the 
difference." According to Jamal, presenting AOL as a community of 
members, "emphasizing chat," was a big 
factor in the leap AOL's membership has taken from 500,000 to five 
million.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If AOL is cozily exclusive, the Net has more free-for-alls: general chat sites 
that are open to anyone with a 
connection, and that function as electronic homes for people of varying 
backgrounds and nationalities.

"Cyber-backpacking" is the phrase Alinta, a 32-year-old Australian job 
counselor, uses to describe it. "You 
get to meet people from other countries--it's made me a more aware sort of 
person."  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And as a single mom, she's found chat "liberating."  "Once the kids have 
gone to bed," she says, "you can't 
so much as sneak down to the corner market.  But with the Net, you can get 
online and have amazing sexual 
experiences--or chat with some sweet old lady 
in England about how she makes pumpkin scones."
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Roxy, also 32, married and a mother of two, felt "hermitized" at home 
before she discovered chatting on 
the Net.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"I injured my back and could no longer work in my retail job," she explains. 
To earn money, she started a 
home day care operation.  That allowed for her physical limitations, but she 
says that "in my business, 
conversation is on a 2-year-old level."  And her house, she adds, "is located 
on 32 acres of woods. No 
neighbors and I didn't know anyone in the area--nor was I able to travel out 
to meet people.  My operating 
hours are from 6:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., taking up most 
of the day, plus setup time and cleanup time--See where the Net ties in?" 
And indeed the Net, in addition to 
being right there on your desk, is open 24 hours.
<BR>
<IMG WIDTH=81 HEIGHT=81 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="dot.gif" HSPACE=3 VSPACE=3 ALT="dot">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Adult conversation would describe what I needed," Roxy says.  And what 
kind of conversation has she 
found?  "Everything!  You name it, we chat about it!  We tease each other, 
comfort each other, laugh, cry--all 
that a family would do and more. We've filled voids and gaps in our lives, 
grown and gotten to know one 
another in a way that RT has never been able to offer." Chatting, she says, 
"holds no boundaries, no limits, no 
judgments."
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Similarly, Makeda, 29, from Colorado, says, "I've built friendships here that 
have been deeper and more 
sharing than ones I have in ëreal life.'  We talk on the phone, send pictures 
of ourselves, our kids. I have a few 
friends who are almost like immediate family. I've seen people rally around 
and support" financially, as well 
as just with an ear or a shoulder--a woman who was in an abusive 
relationship.  With no other outlet but her 
computer, she found support, built her self-esteem, learned that life was not 
supposed to be like it was for her. 
She and her daughter are doing very well by themselves now. Those 
relationships mean a lot to me.  They <I>are</I> 
real."
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thomas DiPiero, Ph.D., a 
professor at the University of Rochester who has taken an interest in the 
sociological aspects of chat, bristles a 
bit at the imposed distinction between chat and "real life."  "Of course it's 
real," he says. "It really is very much 
like the previous generation's fascination with pen pals. You wouldn't see 
the person you were writing letters 
to, but no one said that wasn't real."
<BR>
<IMG WIDTH=81 HEIGHT=81 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="dot.gif" HSPACE=3 VSPACE=3 ALT="dot">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"The interesting question for me is why we pathologize it, why make it into 
an 'addiction?'" he goes on to 
say. "That seems to mask a funny anxiety about how technology works in 
our lives. There's a 
concern about the growing gap between the technological haves and have-
nots, and people seem to be 
pathologizing any behavior that points to that gulf."
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While chatting as an activity is a real thing, participants may find 
themselves to be in a fantasy world in that 
it's possible for them to be anyone on the Net.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Even that can have its "real" effects, however. Perry, a 22-year-old student, 
says he's "more outgoing" in 
"VT" ("virtual time," in contrast to "RT"), but that the ability to overcome 
his shyness and chat has triggered 
an ability to do the same in other areas of his life.  Through chatting, he 
says, "You get a sense of what you're 
capable of. I mean, if it is seemingly so easy to be this outgoing in VT, then 
what's stopping you from doing it 
in RT? I've sort of gained a 'What the heck, just go for it,' attitude from 
chatting on the Net.  I just think, 'If I 
can do it VT, why not RT?'" 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And that boosted confidence does carry over, he finds: "I've used it 
whenever I hesitate to talk to a pretty 
girl, even if it's just to say hello or talk about an assignment in class with 
them.  I guess I've always been 
intimidated by beautiful girls!" 
<BR>
<IMG WIDTH=81 HEIGHT=81 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="dot.gif" HSPACE=3 VSPACE=3 ALT="dot">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hey, who isn't? But online, it isn't hard to be a beautiful girl, much less talk 
to one. Art, a 25-year-old 
HTML coder from Chicago, points out that in the avatar-based Palace chat 
(<A HREF="http://www.thepalace.com">http://www.thepalace.com</A>), which 
allows users to select an image to "be" while chatting, "anyone who chooses 
an attractive female avatar" gets 
instant attention. "It seems to really, honestly affect that person's 
desirability. Even if we all know at some 
level that it's only an indication of how that person wants to be 
perceived, we're programmed to respond to it."
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If it's easy to get attention by just claiming to be gorgeous, it's a good deal 
less so to ascertain who really is 
good-looking. And yet one of the benefits of chat, participants say, is that 
you can't sort out the Barneys from 
the Baldwins.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tiphany, 19, from Canada, says, "I'm heaps more tolerant of VT people 
than RT ones.  What I mean is, in 
VT I don't see what people are wearing, what they look like, their tone of 
voice, even age and stuff like that--things that in RT would maybe put 
me off people. Everyone is acceptable." 
And when that "blind" exchange of 
words leads to intimacy and trust, people can and often do take their chat 
relationships into real time, as 
Tiphany exemplifies. In her recent travel to Australia, she stayed with her 
"closest VT friend."
<BR>
<IMG WIDTH=81 HEIGHT=81 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="dot.gif" HSPACE=3 VSPACE=3 ALT="dot">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"We're very different," she says.  "I don't think we'd ever be friends, if we 
just met in RT--but we got 
comfortable with each other long before we ever met!"  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Finding people to "get comfortable with," people whom circumstance, 
personal prejudice or simple 
geography might have kept away from you, is perhaps the most compelling 
reason to get on the Net and get 
talking.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Smutty pictures you can get any ol' place.
