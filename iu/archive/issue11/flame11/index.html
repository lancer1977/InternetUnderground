The decision to remain silent is an act of conscience, just like the decision to 
speak.  So the view, that acts of "private 
censorship" violate rights of free speech, is incoherent. If an online service 
provider ousts a Web site that posts explicit messages about sex, in violation of 
the terms of their service 
contract, or a non-profit organization persuades some Internet Service Providers 
to refuse to host "Holocaust Revisionist" Web sites, these decisions do not 
violate rights of free speech.  
<P>
Indeed, such private content selection decisions are themselves acts of free 
speech. They are just like a newspaper editor's decision not to run a certain 
letter to the editor, or a publisher's decision not to publish a certain book. The 
editor and publisher have created a means of distributing speech.  The outlet 
they have created is their property, and they have the right to decide what to do 
with it.  Other private companies in the speech distribution business are no 
different.
<P>
Private content selection has the superficial feel of government censorship. 
But it's dangerous to confuse the two. To see what can happen, let's accept the 
premise that a private company that refuses to provide a forum for speech 
violates the would-be speaker's free speech rights. This is a very serious charge. 
Assuming government exists for some legitimate purpose, it surely exists to 
protect our rights. If the ISP or OSP mentioned above is violating someone's 
rights, it logically follows that the government should take action against them. 
<P>
First, this means that the government would become responsible for 
overseeing the distribution of computer network content. Clearly, this is not a 
very good idea. Second, fortunately, it's fundamentally incompatible with the First 
Amendment. The Supreme Court recognizes that "[t]he right of freedom 
of thought protected by the First Amendment against state action includes both 
the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all." And the 
right to refrain from speaking includes the right not to provide a forum for other 
speakers (a misguided case or two to the contrary notwithstanding).
<P>
Any premise that leads us toward more government control over computer 
networks should be questioned. Where does the notion that private content 
selection violates free speech rights come from? Often, it stems from the view 
that we have rights to speech because "more speech is good." On this view, free 
speech rights float out in the ether, with no connection to any other aspect of our 
world and come into play whenever we need "more speech." But free speech 
rights are nothing like that. They're just another aspect of property rights and 
only extend as far as property rights. Free speech doesn't mean I have the right 
to walk into my neighbor's house to make a speech, or write an essay, however 
enlightened, on the wall of an office building.   
<P>
Another fallacy behind the premise is the view that free speech rights come 
into play against anyone who has a lot of power over anyone else. And, the 
theory goes, ISPs and OSPs just have too much power. They might, in some 
very hypothetical unlikely future, turn into monopolists. 
<P>
This argument also goes too far, too fast, in the wrong direction. ISPs and 
OSPs don't have any more power over authors than the New York Times or any 
big publishing house. Most parents have even more power over their children.  
These kinds of power relationships are a necessary and natural part of life; 
anyone who has something we want or need will have power over us. This 
doesn't mean that if someone is exercising that power, he or she is violating our 
rights.  A theory of rights that aims to do away with these power relationships is 
fundamentally unrealistic; its ultimate aim would have to be to abolish reality 
itself. By contrast, it is both necessary and proper to expect rights to provide a 
line of defense against the kind of power uniquely exercised by government--the 
power of soldiers and police.  
<P>
So, we might criticize private content selection decisions as intolerant. We 
could point out that suppressing "revisionist" nonsense about the Holocaust 
might backfire, and that the truth should be brought out in open discussion. We 
might point out that overly restrictive ISPs and OSPs will lose customers. But 
none of this has anything to do with rights of "free speech"  protected against 
true censorship by the First Amendment.

Far from being the saviors of the Net, corporations may be the ruin of 
cyberspace.


<P>
Let's be clear: governments have done plenty to hurt the Net. By passing the 
Communications Decency Act (CDA), the U.S. Congress extended television-
style censorship to the Net. Other countries are close behind.
<P>
But governments aren't the worst of the cybercensors--the CDA has been 
declared unconstitutional and netizens are organizing internationally. Private 
businesses pose the more sinister threat to free expression online.
<P>
Take America Online (AOL), which now boasts over six million members. In a 
move akin to the paranoid antics of a kindergarten schoolmarm, AOL this 
summer started deleting messages posted in Spanish and Portuguese since its 
monitors can't understand them. Undercover AOL cops continue to yank 
accounts of mothers who talk about breast feeding and mention the word 
"nipple." The company's gapingly broad "terms of service" agreement allows it to 
boot anyone, anytime, for any reason.
<P>
Or consider private universities. Carnegie Mellon University bans sexually-
explicit Usenet newsgroups--including innocuous ones devoted to Japanese 
anime--and "offensive" comments posted online. Cornell University forced 
students who offended campus feminists with an e-mail satire to plea-bargain to 
"voluntary" punishment. Brigham Young University disciplines students for 
downloading porn.
<P>
Don't forget net-filtering software. While busily touting itself as anti-censorship, 
CyberSitter quietly blocks the National Organization 
of Women and Queer Resources Directory Web sites. CyberPatrol prevents teen 
pornhounds from investigating animal and gun rights pages and, inexplicably, 
the Electronic Frontier Foundation's censorship archive. NetNanny cuts off AIDS 
resources including the sci.med.aids and clari.tw.health. aids newsgroups. 
SurfWatch bans domestic partner Web pages and Columbia University's award-
winning "Health Education and Wellness" site.
<P>
Now, I don't dispute that state censorship is more heinous. The government 
has guns, police, and gallows to back up its laws. Anyone caught violating the 
CDA gets slammed with a $250,000 fine and two years in Club Fed.
<P>
But to focus exclusively on the evils of government censorship is myopic. 
Private censorship also shrinks the marketplace of ideas, a concept California 
recognized when it passed a law striking down private speech codes at 
universities.
<P>
That's why considering only the "speech rights" of businesses without looking 
at the effects the *exercise* of the rights have is bonkers. It ignores the very real 
effects of private censorship online which is more insidious and harder to 
combat. And perhaps getting worse.
<P>

<B>PUBLIC SQUARES IN CYBERSPACE</B>

<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
People claim the street as theirs on two occasions: to protest and to celebrate.
<BR>


Throughout the history of the United States, there always have been readily 
available public spaces where people can assemble freely. In lawyerspeak, 
these spaces are "public forums" and aren't subject to content-based censorship. 
The only restrictions the state may impose, such as a requirement for a permit, 
must be unrelated to the protesters' message. People can scream "U.S. out of 
Vietnam," "legalize child pornography," or any politically explosive message they 
choose.
<P>
Where will the public squares exist in 21st century cyberspace?
<P>
Nowhere. Cyberspace is and likely will continue to be controlled by 
corporations. Unlike in meatspace, there is no public forum for controversial 
expression that offends the multinationals that jointly own the Net.
<P>
Sure, it's trivial to shift your embattled Web site from one Internet service 
provider to another. Right now, at least. In Canada, Marc Lemire didn't find it so 
easy when his "White Nationalist" site was kicked off of a number of ISPs in 
quick succession. (The Simon Wiesenthal Center has been busy firing off terse 
letters to Lemire's ISPs and clamoring for government crackdowns as well.) 
<P>
This problem will become acute if the small number of Internet backbone 
providers like MCI and Sprint, which number only in the single digits, buckle to 
public pressure from groups like the Wiesenthalers and refuse to provide 
connections to ISPs that host controversial Web sites.
<P>
If that happens, netizens will find their rosy vision of the Net as the birthplace 
of a new form of democracy 
overwhelmed by the sad reality of a new media oligarchy aborning.
