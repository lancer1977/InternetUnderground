You'd probably recognize his face before you'd recognize his name.  Small character
<IMG WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=145 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="bc1.gif" VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5 ALT="Bruce"> 
roles in movies like <I>Escape From L.A.</I> (Surgeon General), <I>Congo</I> 
(Charles Travis) and <I>The Hudsucker Proxy</I> (Smitty), and the principal role in 
the likable but canceled television show <I>Brisco County Jr.</I>, have exposed 
Bruce Campbell to mainstream film and TV viewers. But in the cinema cult 
underworld of the Net, Campbell is best known for his hysterically deadpan 
performance as Ash, the comically tortured chainsaw-wielding nemesis of all things 
undead in the <I>Evil Dead</I> trilogy. In fact, a brief search by our staff dug up 
over 35 Campbell-specific fan sites, and many, many more related links. 
<P>
Campbell, who recently returned to the States from 
<IMG WIDTH=93 HEIGHT=123 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="bc2.gif" VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5 ALT="Bruce"> 

a remote shoot somewhere 
in Mexico for the upcoming Paramount film <I>McHale's Navy</I>, says his film 
career began back in high school, "400 years ago," when he and director Sam 
Raimi (<I>Darkman</I>, <I>The Quick and the Dead</I>) met in drama class in 
Birmingham, Mich. "We were both doing pantomimes and they both sucked. So we 
consoled each other. And we kind of went from there...he would do magic shows at 
bar mitzvahs and stuff, and I would be his assistant. I think for Sam, movies became 
the ultimate magic show because movies are the ultimate sleight of hand. And then 
we just began making 
a bunch of Super 8 movies on weekends." 
<P>
<I>Evil Dead</I>, produced on a wafer-thin $350,000 budget, was the first 
major motion picture Campbell and Raimi produced together. In 1983, at the 
Cannes Film Festival (the same year <I>The Shining</I> was released in theaters), 
<I>Evil Dead</I> managed to catch the eye of horror maven Stephen King who 
<IMG WIDTH=92 HEIGHT=128 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="bc3.gif" VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5 ALT="Bruce"> 
called it the year's "most ferociously original horror movie." From his film debut and 
thereafter, Campbell has become a major cult hero--Hollywood is starting to bank 
on his underground status, and Disney recently struck an agreement to have 
Campbell star in an undisclosed action/adventure television series. 
<P>
As a major Web junkie, Campbell seemed an ideal choice for "On the Net With." 
So, sit back, relax and enjoy as the king of cult gives the goods on a fan named 
Death Dog, a digital Jack Nicholson and Hollywood's fascination with stupid 
computer sound effects.

I think a lot of users relate to the <I>Evil Dead</I> movies. The real appeal is to the 
college kids because those movies 
are extremely irreverent and they can identify with that sort of lead character, 
always pissed off, struggling against the odds, and he fails a lot. And that's the 
only thing I can figure out.

Yeah, 
           I posted it, I let it out. 
			           Because it's a grass roots thing. How else do you 
know whether people think your stuff sucks, but by direct contact. I get asked the 
same types of questions so I actually have about half a dozen, not press 
releases, but responses. It would be as though I had a spokesman. ÎHere's the 
official word on this, and here's the 
official word on this. This is just a rumor.' Half of what I do is damage control, 
because of all these ridiculous rumors about what movies I'm going to be in. So I 
can download those files, I can just send a quick note to say, ÎHey Joe, thanks 
for the note, here's something for you to look at.' And others just ask, ÎWhat are 
you up to?' So instead of just typing in the same thing each time, I can attach a 
file that gives them the whole rundown.

Yeah, there's a lot of weird stuff out there. There's a lot of skepticism too. A lot of 
people will drop an e-mail and say, ÎI know some other person will be answering 
this.' I've spent a lot of time trying to convince people that it's actually me by 
saying, ÎWell, quiz me on something only I would know.' It's really absurd. Here's 
the thing that kills me though...when I was a kid, you couldn't send e-mail to 
William Shatner. And now you can. And there are now a fair amount of actors 
logging on. In a weird sort of way, the Net is bringing back the lost art of letter 
writing. Even though the grammar I get is unbelievable. I have to reinterpret 
everything. And you don't know how old these people are, that's another weird 
thing. I get a lot of e-mail that'll just be from like 
DEATH DOG. 
So I'll write back ÎDear DEATH DOG, thanks for your note, whoever the hell you 
are.'

Oh yeah, I've stopped at a number of them. And there are several that I have to 
say are pretty darn inventive. They're not the standard click here for a sound 
byte deal. And I try and help them out and keep them current. I don't search 
these places out, but anyone who sends me an e-mail, like Joe Blow who 
maintains a Bruce is God Web Site, if he wants to know what's going on, I'll just 
ship him a file. But I don't send pictures around though÷I wish I knew how to do 
that.

I buy airline tickets. I keep really weird schedules and I don't often have access 
to a travel agent, so this way I can just sit at midnight and dick around with my 
travel plans. And they've just expanded it now to car rental and hotel so now I'll 
never get off the damn thing.

As someone in Hollywood who actually has an understanding of the online 
realm, what do you think of film's sensationalized depiction of the 
technology in movies like <I>The Net</I> with Sandra Bullock?

My favorite part of <I>The Net</I> was all the ridiculous sound effects they gave to 
every computer move. Like a window would come up 
and it would go, swooshsh. 
Or like Sandra would be scrolling through something and you'd hear, blrrrrrrrrrrr, 
blrrrrrrrrrr. It's only so the audience wouldn't fall asleep I think.

The other thing too is that everyone has these kick-ass systems. No one has a 
clunky system that takes an hour to download something. It's always instant. It's 
like they have fiber optic running into the back of their computer. It's usual 
though, it's a typical Hollywood thing. They don't have a clue.

I have to say, I'm doing my best to stay current. One, because I'm trying to stay 
up with at least a primitive version of technology. I can go online, download 
scripts, send stuff to friends. For example, I was in North Carolina working on a 
TV show and a guy calls me from Detroit who says, ÎJeez, I really wish I had that 
so-and-so contract because I'm meeting with this guy today.' I take my computer 
wherever I go, so I was able to instantly send my version of the contract. It was 
faster than Federal Express and it only costs you log-on time. And I don't know 
how else we could have done it. So even that is still primitive compared to a lot 
of stuff out there, but I'm doing the best I can to not get buried in the crush. I just 
did a voice character for a CD-ROM game. It's something I really want to keep 
pursuing because I think eventually they'll have little movies on CDs. It's getting 
to the point where whatever you can imagine, they can do. I used to joke, one 
day they're going to come to Jack Nicholson, and Acme Digital Company is 
going to say, "You know Jack, you've had a long great career. Why don't you go 
to Tahiti and relax for a while. But before you do that, come to our studio, and 
we're going to photograph you from every conceivable angle and we're going to 
take you into our sound studio and get you recording all of the letters of the 
alphabet, and every possible motion. And we're going to have you bring in every 
photograph you've got of yourself. And that's going to be virtual Jack."

Yeah, and everyone used to think that was so funny, and called me crazy. And 
then I did this thing called <I>Love Bug</I>. It was a remake of the original 
<I>Love Bug</I> for Disney. A guy showed up on the set and started taking 
reference photographs of me. I said ÎWhat are these for?' He said, ÎWell that's for 
when we make a CGI of the car popping a wheelie, we can put you in the car 
and it will actually be you. When stuff like that happens on just a made-for-TV 
movie, because this is not some Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, you start 
thinking, ÎWell, they'll probably use [digital] actors for stunts, and it'll start like 
that, and then it'll expand to the point where Jack says, ÎHey, it's just a long shot, 
put the CGI guy in. I gotta go play golf.' These are just theories of course, but in 
10 years, I don't think anybody is going to be laughing. And I heard that Demi 
Moore got her body scanned during <I>Striptease</I> because she thought 
Îthat's the best I'm ever going to look, 
I might as well have it on record in case 
I'm ever going to need it.' So she's digitized.

I think it is fascinating on the one hand, so long as they don't try and create 
actors out of nothing. That's the only thing that bugs me. Hopefully they'll still 
need some poor sap to read the lines. And if they want to sample me, 
sample me, but at least it'll be my image.
