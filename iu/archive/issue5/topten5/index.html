Scrolling text along the bottom of the site says, "I must not think bad thoughts..." but they're so tasty, those thoughts which coagulate around your imagination causing disruption, disturbance and neglect. Feed your carnal needs and devour this phenomenal site which is best described as an artists' commune. This site is a drug: a sick, sagacious lyric in electronic sing-song. Indulge and be indulged alike. (For the full story behind this site, see Spotlight, page 60.)

Most likely, unsuspecting browsers happen upon this site expecting to find the famed director. However, there is so much content 
here, the legend o' film is quickly forgotten. Altman, a former photojournalist for Rolling Stone, packs his site with awesome 
footage of Timothy Leary, Iggy Pop, Mick Jagger, Abbie Hoffman and many other popular and subversive figures from the past four 
decades. Beyond the photos, there's much more to discover in this pleasure chest.

If you can't stop 'em, adopt 'em. Just in time for Easter, the House Rabbit Society's site is devoted to rescuing abandoned bunnies 
and giving them new homes. The HRS is not an obscure organization; it has offices all across the U.S. and can help you adopt no 
matter where you live. Visit the "Bunny Gallery" to pick your own rabbit: White, black, brown, potty-trained -- if only dating sites 
were so simple. At the very least, check out the abundant bunny info pages and learn how to say "rabbit" in Esperanto.

Most surprising is the opening line: "We hope you'll find this site useful and fun." It may sound like we're sucking up to The Man in 
hopes of a tax break, but the IRS Home Page is actually entertaining and no question, useful. The jokes are corny, but the graphics 
are well-displayed -- not the drab product you're used to seeing from a government agency. IRS forms, publications, locations for 
filing and tax FAQs are available at the site as well. Leona Helmsley and Willie Nelson have no excuses now.

Need a break from your dreary day? Visit Fellowbug's Lab for some old-fashioned fun and nonsense. Inside you'll find "The Daily 
Noise," a new random downloadable sound clip every day, "Letter R.I.P," a variation of Hangman in which guessing wrong makes 
the limbs fall off a zombie and "The Keepers of Lists" who compile responses to topics like "Reasons Why Chicks Dig Fabio" or "Frat 
Guy Nicknames For Dole."

Grease, when prepared right, rivals the cuisine at any haughty five-star restaurant, and Roadside On the Web is your guide to 
finding the best cholesterol in the country. Roadside, an online companion to the paper-and-ink magazine of the same name, 
delves into diner culture with reviews, recipes, pleas for preservation, interviews and info on purchasing a real diner of your own.

You're a big R.E.M. fan, but will you like John Coltrane? Head over to Firefly, and let their computers figure it out for you. At Firefly 
you begin by rating a whole mess of albums and artists. The more you rate, the smarter the service gets, eventually replacing 
those suggestions of Yanni with Tom Waits. Their database is immense, with downloadable sound clips, reviews and bios. For 
now, Firefly is limited to music, but expansion plans call for movies, books and Web sites to be added this year.

When it comes to the Web, Feed's Editor in Chief, Steven Johnson, is both a skeptic and an admirer. His catechizing editorial both 
questions and makes observations on the roles multimedia and the Internet are playing and will continue to play in our rapidly 
expanding technoculture -- as  does much of this e-zine's remarkably well-written content. But it's way more than just a tech-heavy 
'zine -- Feed also includes stories and debates on mass media, film, music and more. All in all, Feed is easily one of the most 
thought-provoking sites on the Web.

Now you too can learn more about the art/sport of sumo wrestling. Be a hit at all the parties. Impress your friends with lines like 
"I here you can achieve Yusho by knocking your opponent out of the dohyo, okuridashi style." At SumoWeb! you can browse 
current statistics detailing Japan's top sumo talent, or worst (poor Ozeki Takanonami is constantly ridiculed for his losing record). 
The page also offers visitors a glossary of fun-to-pronounce words, sport rules and regulations, news reports, topical essays and a 
few wrestling tips to try on dad.

Billed as the Horror Web Page, come feed your horror jones with archives of horror sights and sounds. "Dr." Casey Hopkins has 
also included an original horror atlas and timeline compiled by David Carroll so you can check out what horror movies take place 
in Wyoming or the big horror events of the 1530s. Best of all is the The Horror Movie Poster Archive -- don't miss the original art 
from classics like Attack of the Crab Monsters.
