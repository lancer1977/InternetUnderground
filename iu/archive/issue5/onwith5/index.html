He wants to give his music away.</B>

That's right. Make it available for anyone to download free. In a career that has spanned more than a 
quarter-century, and featured such hits as "Hello, It's Me" and "I Saw the Light," <FONT COLOR=C40024>Rundgren</FONT> has sold a lot of 
records. But he's never been quite comfortable with it. At various points, it appears as if he intentionally  
submarined his own imminent rock stardom by following a commer-
cialy successful project with 
something patently experimental.
<P>
"As far as my art goes, I'm trying to structure my life so that I can give it away," <FONT COLOR=C40024>Rundgren</FONT> says. "I don't 
feel comfortable charging 
people for it. I have pretenses to being a fine artist. The record industry is becoming too ridiculous. It has 
completely destroyed the concept of music as art. You don't qualify as a musician unless you sell records. 
Everyone who makes a record thinks, ÎThis has got to sell.' What is that doing to their art? They wouldn't do 
certain things unless it sold. I don't want that kind of paint on my personal expression."
"I can produce records for money and have other means of income, but I want to make records just to 
make them. At this point, it is possible for me not to depend on record sales any longer. I want to deliver to 
anyone who's interested."

<FONT COLOR=C40024>Rundgren</FONT>, a musician who has long danced on the leading edge of technology, embraced interactive music 
in the '90s. "I am the poster boy for interactivity," he says with a laugh. (He has even given himself a nom-de-disque: TR-i, for "<FONT COLOR=C40024>Todd Rundgren</FONT> Interactive.") In 1993, he was the first pop music artist to create and release 
an interactive CD-ROM. Titled No World Order, 
it allowed the user/listener to manipulate and deconstruct via computer the various sounds, textures 
and sequences throughout the disc. At the same time <FONT COLOR=C40024>Rundgren</FONT> wrote and recorded the music, 
he and assisting programmers were developing a test bed for the 
new technology. "My goal in No  World Order was to probe the concept of interactive music," he explains. "It 
required me to think about the music in certain ways. The music had to be cut up so that it could be moved 
around. ÎWe have to keep these transitions clean. I can't put lyrics that overlap where the cuts might be.' After 
that, my objective was to get back to something more musical."  
<P>
To that end, he released The Individualist last fall. A departure from the techno-ized, sometimes cold flavor 
of No World Order, the disc is something of a return to the pop melodies associated with his earlier work, 
although the tracks are largely synthesizer-driven. Instead of making it a fully interactive disc, he opted for CD-plus, a software format that works in conventional compact disc players, but when plugged into a CD-ROM 
offers additional graphic elements. 
<P>
"This one's about music," <FONT COLOR=C40024>Rundgren</FONT> says. "I had to be able to service the traditional buying audience, but if 
you happen to have a computer and a ROM drive, you can put it in there and enhance the experience to some 
degree. There is some degree of interactivity. It adds  another vector."

<FONT COLOR=C40024>Todd Rundgren</FONT> is not a 'net hog. There's simply not enough time. In fact, you could easily nickname him 
Backslash: songwriter/producer/voc-alist/instrumentalist/programmer/ graphic artist/consultant/poster boy.  
Rundgren does use the 'net for specific purposes, but to co-opt a 
line from Apocalypse Now, "<FONT COLOR=C40024>Todd</FONT> 
don't surf."  
<P>
"I get in every once in awhile when I have something specific to look for," he says. "But I don't spend time 
there for personal enjoyment. Then I would be forced to stop trying to put meaning into things. Everything 
that happens to me is pregnant with meaning. I look at the Web as this kind of giant public domain CD-ROM, 
kind of like shareware but with a browser. A lot of the stuff on there is hack work that people just threw 
together. Some of them crash your machine. It's not well-supported or maintained. You may occasionally come 
upon extraordinary unsung works of one kind or another, but at this point the frantic commercialization of the 
Web is something of a disincentive to cruise. It's like a strip mall. There's all these hot buttons. It's like riding 
along a Dallas highway where there's nothing but fucking billboards. It's hard to find substantive content. And 
<IMG WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=99 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/nwocd.gif" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>
it's obscured by blizzards of links, which attaches crap to crap."  
Despite his misgivings, <FONT COLOR=C40024>Rundgren</FONT> sees potential value in the Internet. He has signed on with CompuServe 
to create a new interactive music forum. The area is expected to go live on June 1 and will offer information 
about the emerging world 
of interactive music, as well as images, video clips, MIDI (Musical Instrumental Digital Interface) and sound 
files that members can manipulate to concoct their own blends of music and images. Members will also be able 
to contribute files and samples to produce collaborative efforts that span continents. 
"Our 'net presence will bypass the Web," <FONT COLOR=C40024>Rundgren</FONT> explains. "You'll use 'net protocol to get into our 
application. The flat world browsing thing will be for the strip mall crowd. We're setting up something more 
like a Neiman Marcus. It will be a place unto itself. If we do that, we can make sure the resources are provided. 
Our whole paradigm is that everyone loves the 'net, but the problem is the Web is based on print, a page 
format paradigm. Everything looks like a magazine or a catalogue, despite all the attempts to add plug-ins. The 
impression is you get this hydra-headed monster being burdened beyond its original design. It's like putting 
wings on a dog."
<P>

"In general, the Web is a good way of finding what's out there, but not a good way of presenting what's out 
there," he says. 
<P>
"You'll be able to find us on the Web, you can FTP to us. We will create a visceral experience that you 
would expect out of local resources like CD-ROMs or television. People talk themselves into being intrigued 
by postage stamp-sized QuickTime movies. I just don't buy that. I don't enjoy it. I want something to fill the 
whole screen, have nice sound, good quality music, an immersive experience. And it will not be a sales-
oriented thing."

<FONT COLOR=C40024>Rundgren</FONT>, 47, grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia. After flirtations with garage bands and regional acts, he 
became the central figure in the Beatles-esque group, the Nazz. At 21, he signed with Warner Brothers as a solo 
artist. His initial project saw the then budding virtuoso sing, overlay instruments and engineer. The resulting 
LP, Runt, sold more than 100,000 copies, a fair showing. Word circulated within the music biz of his 
multifaceted musical and technical aplomb. The wunderkind engineered seminal albums by The Band. 
<FONT COLOR=C40024>Rundgren</FONT> reached his commercial zenith when he produced Meatloaf's 1977 smash Bat Out of Hell. He used 
the financial windfall to build 
his own $2 million video 
production facility.
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=175 HEIGHT=225 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="art/cover.gif" VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10>

Along the way, <FONT COLOR=C40024>Rundgren</FONT> made a few classic albums of his own. The 1972 double album-set titled 
Something/ Anything? produced and performed by Rundgren alone is considered a classic. In '74, he formed 
the progressive power-pop group Utopia, foreshadowing the "new wave" scene that would happen a half-
decade later.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=C40024>Rundgren's</FONT> resum&eacute; of technological firsts is impressive. In 1978, he performed both the first interactive 
television concert and the first live radio broadcast nationally by microwave, linking 40 cities around the 
country. The following year, he opened Utopia Video Studios. His first project, Gustav Holt's The Planets, was 
commissioned by RCA as the first demonstration software for its then-spanking new video-disc format.
In 1980, <FONT COLOR=C40024>Rundgren</FONT> directed and produced Time Heals, the first video to combine live action and computer 
graphics. It became the second clip to be played on MTV. In 1981, he developed the first digital paint program 
for PCs, which he licensed to Apple. In '82, he performed the first live national cablecast of a rock concert via 
the USA Network. With his forays into interactivity, <FONT COLOR=C40024>Rundgren</FONT> looks to be a pivotal figure in how music is 
created and perceived in the not-too-distant future. He wants to help restore what he calls the "plasticity" of 
music. Before the onset of recording, he says, people sang drinking songs in pubs and would add new verses 
based on the events of the day.
<P>
He thinks some of pop music's pliant nature can be re-introduced via more sophisticated means. In an 
interview last year, he described a scenario whereby he could get up in the morning, work on a musical idea 
and upload it onto the 'net. If the next day he wanted to add a solo or change a troublesome note, he could 
tweak the music and upload again.  "There are a number of ways to look at that issue," he says. "Do you allow 
people the window into the working process or do you deliver the finished product? Do you open lines for 
feedback? As an artist, I want the option to do it, although I don't necessarily have the proclivity to do it."  He 
doesn't see the method being embraced by the pop community at large. "So many artists are concerned with 
creating an image of themselves, an image which is not necessarily accurate," he says. "They don't want their 
music deconstructed so people can find out truly about the artist. The ones who will be most uptight about 
having their music recontexturalized and examined are the ones with a basic self-consciousness about it. They 
might be found out. Perhaps their work is sloppy, or an obvious reflection of their influences; perhaps they're 
completely incapable of performing this under circumstances other than the recording studio."
<P>
One area where the interactive poster boy finds little interactivity is in the arena of pop concerts. Such a 
notion flies in the face of those technologically wary folk who view live performance as perhaps a last 
bastion of true artistic give-and-take. 
<P> 
<IMG WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=100 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/tricd.gif" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>
"Despite what you might hear otherwise, when acts go on the road, the specific objective is to go out and 
play the same set every night," he contends. "How long the guitar solo is is 
the only interactivity with most acts. Very few bands 
that I have seen would qualify as being interactive. Frank Zappa rehearsed his bands so thoroughly that, 
through a whole language of cues, he could jump from the chorus of one song to the vamp of 
another song on a dime."
<P>

His attitude is decidedly different. "When I took my band out last summer, we tried to keep some kind of 
interactive dynamic. 
<P>
There was no song list. We never knew what song we were going to do until the last one was finished. I 
demanded that in order to keep everyone on their toes. So we rarely, if ever, played the same sequence of 
songs. It's not monumental in terms of interactivity, but at least it kept it interesting for me.  
<P>

"It sure beats doing 50 shows glancing down at the same tattered set list. That was like the commute home. 
You've seen it all before, you zone out and endure it. Live performance outside of jazz is pretty much a rote 
experience. It's merely a re-telling and it seems essentially pointless." All told, <FONT COLOR=C40024>Rundgren</FONT> is an artist who holds 
himself to the highest standard of self-expression, who genuinely refuses to compromise his muse, whether it's 
playing guitar in front of a crowd, working at his computer for hours, or attempting to rap for the first time, as 
he did on No World Order. It takes courage. This most verbose of men finally sums up his philosophy in one 
pointed sentence: "Art to me is a public act of self-examination."
