Had the Internet been a reality in the late '20s, the trio and their fellow expatriates may likely have idled 
away the hours sipping espresso and posting to alt.bullfighting at Cyberia or any of the other number of 
cybercaf&eacute;s that now crowd Paris' Left Bank. 
<P>
With businesses looking to  expand their niches as a route to survival, (witness the combination Taco Bell/ 
Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet I pass every day on the way to work) the Internet caf&eacute; is the perfect marriage of 
the two biggest phenomena of the decade: $2.88 mochas and 28.8k modems.

Essentially cybercaf&eacute;s can be divided into two categories: caf&eacute;s that happen to feature Internet connections 
and computer labs that happen to serve cappuccino. Once the novelty factor has passed, the key to prosperity 
in this booming business may be successfully blending both components. "We are a fully integrated caf&eacute;, says 
Thomas Wise, co-owner of the <B>Cyber Caf&eacute;</B> (<A HREF="http://www.bid.com/bid/cybercafe/"><B>http://www.bid.com/bid/cybercafe/</B></A>) in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City. "We're not like a bar that just stuck a couple of 
pinball machines in. The Internet is integrated into everything we do." 
<P>
Wise, who along with his partners opened the caf&eacute; last summer, says business has been brisk, with patrons 
coming in to get wired on both caffeine and the 'net. "Everything you need to know about the 'net is here," 
says Wise. Indeed the Cyber Caf&eacute; is fully loaded with a T1 line, state-of-the-art PCs, video cameras, full 
software platforms, even access to all the online services -- all at the rate of $10 an hour. In addition, Wise 
adds, "Our coffee's good. We're all very into our coffee."

Cybercaf&eacute;s are a true global phenomenon. According to the Cyber Caf&eacute; Guide version 12.8 at 
<A HREF="http://www.easynet.co.uk/ pages/cafe/ccafe.htm"><B>http://www.easynet.co.uk/ pages/cafe/ccafe.htm</B></A> there are 54 Internet caf&eacute;s in England alone. From Sydney 
to Cape Town to Rio to Warsaw to Kuala Lumpur, people are sipping 
latt»s and using Lycos. 
<P>
In fact the Internet caf&eacute; can trace its origins to Cyberia in London, which is largely credited by most as 
being the first fully wired caf&eacute;. After reading about Cyberia in magazines, Percy Wang, a co-owner of the 
Interactive Bean, Chicago's first full cybercaf&eacute;, and Dan Barron, co-owner of the Big Surf in Birmingham, 
Mich., were inspired to open their own caf&eacute;s.
<P>
Wang, a 27-year-old multimedia designer, says he and his co-owner, Andrew Laing read about Cyberia and 
decided they needed "a place like that to hang out ourselves." Wang says they originally shelved the idea of a 
caf» to concentrate on their design business, GORP New Media, until clients started asking for help designing 
Web sites. Wang did a little research and since there were essentially no cybercaf&eacute;s in Chicago, the pair decided 
to give it a try. 
<P>
"The Interactive Bean is friendly place," says Wang. Indeed, the <B>Interactive Bean</B> (<A HREF="http://iris.gorpnm.com/ibean/"><B>http://iris.gorpnm.com/ibean/</B></A>) is meant to be a place where a newbie can feel comfortable asking questions while getting their 
feet wet. Wang says the caf&eacute;, which opened in December last year, isn't a techno-macho place. In fact, the staff 
has more of a service background than tech background. "It's easier to teach someone to use Netscape than to 
teach them to be nice to someone." 
<P>

In addition to 10 computers and a T1 line, the Bean offers patrons their own e-mail accounts for $10 a 
month plus discounts on the caf&eacute;'s normal rate of 16 cents a minute for computer time. Wang says he was 
expecting more of a "Generation X-type crowd," but surprisingly the average patron has been in their mid-30s, 
which may speak as much to the caf&eacute;'s strict "no smoking" policy than the lure of the Internet.
Surfing the 'net in a caf&eacute; environment turns what can be a very lonely hobby into a social experience, says 
Wang. It's not unusual for groups of three or four to be clustered around the caf&eacute;'s Macs. Wang likes to 
emphasize the interactive aspect of the caf&eacute;, stressing that even if the Internet boom goes bust, the caf&eacute; still 
features CD-ROMs and other bells and whistles. "We even have Jenga!" says Wang.
<P>
Veronica Barron, who along with her husband Don and four other partners owns the <B>Big Surf</B> 
(<A HREF="http://bigweb.com/cafe/"><B>http://bigweb.com/cafe/</B></A>), also stresses a friendly and accessible atmosphere. In addition to the computers and 
coffee, the caf&eacute; is decorated like a 1940s Jamaican beach hut, which enhances the relaxed atmosphere. 
Barron says the caf&eacute;'s philosophy revolves around two main components: Bring the Internet to the people 
and create a multi-faceted business. "People are sick of sitting in their spare bedroom staring at their 
computers. It's more fun to surf the 'net in our environment, plus it's faster (the caf&eacute; features a T1 line). It's 
just a more satisfying experience."
<P>

The crowd at the Big Surf ranges from moms with toddlers in the morning, to a brisk business lunch, to 
late-night singles hanging out in chat rooms. For newbies the caf&eacute; offers Internet 101 classes that cover all the 
bases or patrons can also ask staff members questions or for site suggestions. 
<P>
<B>Caf&eacute; Liberty</B> (<A HREF="http://cafeliberty.com/"><B>http://cafeliberty.com/</B></A>), located in a basement space in Cambridge, Mass., leans toward the 
caf&eacute; side of the cybercaf&eacute; equation. 
<P>
Jon Sudbury, the caf&eacute;'s 26-year-old co-owner, says he doesn't think it makes sense to open up a new caf&eacute; 
designed primarily for surfing. "A lot of places are opening now that build big elaborate systems... it just 
doesn't make sense. It's like reinventing the wheel." Caf&eacute; Liberty has three computers hooked up to the 'net, 
and at $4 an hour with a T1 connection, Sudbury says the caf&eacute; attracts both novices as well as experts from 
next-door neighbor MIT. "Why would an MIT student use our machines and pay money when they are free at 
school? It turns out that people enjoy dropping by the caf&eacute; during the day and not having to go into the lab to 
check their e-mail. People like to be around other human beings."
<P>
Even though it was the computer aspect that attracted him to the caf&eacute; business, Sudbury says that it's ended 
up being a lot more food service than high tech. "The caf&eacute; stuff takes up 95 percent of the time. Anyone who 
wants to open a caf&eacute; has to be aware that they'll be owning a caf&eacute; primarily." 
Sudbury says that adding terminals to an established caf&eacute; can be as simple as expanding a menu. In fact, 
Sudbury is finalizing plans for Java Link, based on SF Net in San Francisco and Cafenet in Los Angeles, where 
caf&eacute;s can get second-generation units for their patrons to  use, much like pay phones.

When caf&eacute;s first started to gather steam again in the early '90s, most cities featured dozens of independent 
spaces, each with its own unique style and atmosphere. Of course, at the same time there was a small chain in 
Seattle, the coffee capital of the free world, known as Starbucks. Now with the ubiquitous mermaid logo 
dotting seemingly every street corner in the country's urban centers and strip malls in finer suburbs 
everywhere, and many of those early coffee houses now housing bagel shops or fresh baked bread stores, can a 
cybercaf&eacute; chain be far behind? 
<P>






David Green, the co-owner of <B>Caf&eacute; Internet</B> (<A HREF="http://www.cafe-inet.com"><B>http://www.cafe-inet.com</B></A>) in Port Townsend, Wash., is 
betting on it. Green has recently started to offer franchises of his caf&eacute;, offering (besides the trademarked 
name): support services, exclusive apparel, buying power, advertising, established protocols and even Caf&eacute; 
Internet coffees and syrups. 
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=275 HEIGHT=132 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="art/2people.gif" VSPACE=15 HSPACE=15>
So far, Green says he's had inquiries from all over the country. Green, whose own caf&eacute; features a French 
motif with classical music and fresh flowers, three computers and an ISDN connection, says many inquiries 
have come from tourists who stop in the caf&eacute; for a cup of coffee and to check their 
e-mail while they're on vacation. 
<P>
If an ordinary cybercaf&eacute; seems too run-of-the-mill, someday soon you'll be able to sip your espresso 
and browse ESPN from the comfort 
of the top of an authentic double-decker bus. <B>Circus Espresso Bars</B> (<A HREF="http://http://www.island.net/~circus/"><B>http://http://www.island.net/~circus/</B></A>) have 
recently begun to advertise their "Super Cyber Espresso Bus" concept, double-decker buses direct from Great 
Britain with full espresso bars downstairs and computer terminals upstairs. Jonathon Fenton, the co-president 
of Circus, says the buses have the advantage of generating extra excitement; plus if you don't like your location 
you can always just move. At press time, no one had stepped up to purchase a Cyber bus -- a fully loaded one 
costs $64,000 -- but Fenton is so confident that the concept can work he's pitched the idea to Apple and 
Microsoft, hoping one of the corporations would want to 
use a bus as a cyberbookmobile for the '90s. 
<P>
While the number of cybercaf&eacute;s seems to grow every day, it will be consumers who ultimately determine 
whether they're more comfortable in their homes or in a caf&eacute;, surfing and slurping.
