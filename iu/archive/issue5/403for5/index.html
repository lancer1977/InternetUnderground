<FONT SIZE=4><B>When I first arrived at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1992,</B></FONT SIZE=4> I was still high on endorphins and excitement from 
the tattoo my uncle had just given me at his shop, Electric Ink Tattoo. I was high on life. The design had come  out 
perfectly; the knowledge that it was there forever made me even  more excited. It was my mark, my rite of passage, and 
most importantly, my 
nickname -- a jester. It meant something. 
<P>
Aside from the nervousness of being  at college and wondering if I could actually make it, my major concern was how 
I was going to get back to Rhode Island so I could get my uncle to do  more work on me. I tried to find other people that 
were into tattoos and bodyart. Through some friends, I learned about Usenet. It was there that I found rec.arts.
bodyart (RAB).
<P>
RAB was an important find for me. It was small, but popular and I quickly became a regular. RAB became a forum for 
people to discuss bodyart, and for those thinking of getting a 
bodmod to ask questions and opinions before plunging on.
<P>
From communicating with my uncle and eventually apprenticing with him to become a tattoo artist, I picked up a fair 
amount of tattoo knowledge. I  used this knowledge to help people on RAB. As RAB's readership grew, so did the amount 
of e-mail I received. The FAQ for the group grew exponentially, thanks mostly to the efforts of Lani Teshima-Miller. But 
this information was only posted monthly and new readers with old questions were joining every day. Due to the size of 
the FAQ, it was considered that sending it to a new reader over e-mail would be almost rude (it knocked out quite a few 
people's mail servers).  But this information still needed to be available. And that's when the  Web showed up.  Even  if 
users had only Lynx, they could still get at the FAQ. Posting images of tattoos was discouraged, 
so the appearance of URLs at 
the end of people's .sig files became more and  more 
common.
<P>    
In 1995, I decided to learn about the Web. A friend taught me HTML in about a half hour, and I got my first home page 
up and running. I spiced it up with some images I scanned 
at school, pictures of my tattoos and others by my uncle and workers at his shop. Eventually, I added more topics and 
content as I came across it. On the Electric Ink page, I posted portfolios of the artists, directions and contact information. 
The response was enormous. 
<P>
My opinion is that the Internet had come to  the common man. People who were searching for 
information weren't  just scholarly types. Now,  Ma Kettle was looking for recipes, Joe Blow needed to fix his car and 
Kandy Apple wanted a 
tattoo. Some people wonder at the open exchange of information that seems to come with the Internet, but it really isn't 
any more open than any other community. It's just that now you have an easy way to find the people who are willing to 
share information not always readily accessible elsewhere.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4><B>Tattoos were once regarded the stuff of bikers, rockers and sailors.</B></FONT> Now, more people understand the complex 
designs that can be rendered, tattoo parlor health requirements  and the unlikeliness of contracting AIDS from a tattoo 
needle. One of the most frequently asked questions I have seen is "Does it hurt?" Now someone can pose this question to 
a forum of people in the know (such as RAB) and get a serious answer; in the past, they would have to risk the 
embarrassment of asking it and possibly getting heckled. Now more and more people can embrace that primal side of 
their selves, the part that  wants a rite of passage, a way to prove their "toughness" or their  resilience. Or, to just make a 
statement.
<P>
Many might say that increased interest in bodmods is just a fad, but I feel that the interest has always been there and 
always will. It's only more apparent now as it seems more socially acceptable and people are becoming more informed. 
Where the ignorant used to believe tattoos to be dirty and dangerous, they can now discover they are clean and can be 
quite elegant. The Internet, with its means of transitive education, may just be helping to overcome a stigma and creating 
a community at the 
same time.
