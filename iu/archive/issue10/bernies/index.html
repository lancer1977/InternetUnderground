&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tinseltown couldn't have staged a more strained and 
obvious crime scene. On March 13, 1995, at approximately 8 
p.m., four black men driving a rental van with Florida plates 
pulled into a 7-11 parking lot in the mostly Caucasian township 
of Haverford, Penn., just west of Philadelphia. There, they 
waited. A couple of hours later, a second vehicle arrived and a 
white man, dressed in business attire, stepped out and walked 
over to the parked van. The five individuals began to talk and 
engage in what looked like an unlawful transaction.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Detective John Morris of the Haverford Township Police 
remembers receiving a call that night, tipping him off that a 
drug deal was going down at the 7-11. Squad cars were 
immediately dispatched. "I was in an undercover car pulling up 
and I could see that one guy was holding money and it looked like 
an exchange was going on," Morris recounts. "Cars were off to 
the side in a manner other than people who patronize the store 
and it looked out of place, it looked like something was wrong."<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As suspicious as things may have appeared that evening, 
nothing, in fact, was terribly amiss. Ed Cummings, a computer 
and telecommunications consultant, was selling electronics 
parts to a Florida resident who was passing through the 
Philadelphia area. Cummings, better known in the hacker 
community by his handle Bernie S., had been advertising the 
sale of 6.5MHz phone crystals in the hacker quarterly 
magazine, 2600. When used in lieu of standard crystals found 
in ordinary Radio Shack phone dialers, these 6.5MHz crystals 
allow for the programming of special tones -- tones that can be 
employed to trick public phones into thinking coins have been 
deposited. The visitors from Florida, who had seen the ad in 
2600, called Cummings and arranged to meet him at the 7-11.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Despite Cummings' objections that nothing illegal was 
transpiring, Morris remained suspicious and confiscated the 
box of crystals and dialers. Morris agreed to return the 
materials the next day, so long as they "checked out." 
Cummings and the men and women from Florida were allowed 
to leave the scene.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Two days later, Cummings received 
a call from a client (she requested anonymity for this story) 
who needed help installing a new hard drive that had just 
arrived in the mail. She remembers putting her children to 
sleep while Cummings worked away at the installation upstairs. 
It was an ordinary evening -- at least until the doorbell rang 
around 9 p.m. She had visitors.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Unaware, Cummings busily worked upstairs. "I heard 
someone coming up the stairs," he remembers. "Then, 
suddenly, I heard a bunch of men yelling, 'Freeze, Police! 
Police! Secret Service!' I turned to my right and there were six 
armed men all pointing guns at me. They said, ÎDon't move!' I 
was pushing my chair back slowly and moved my hands, 
because I speak with my hands. They got really upset that I 
moved." A couple of officers pushed Cummings to the floor. He 
recalls hearing from over his shoulder, the charge being read to 
him: "You're under arrest for 
possession of equipment for theft of telecommunications 
services."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From this point on, depending on who you speak with, the 
facts of the Ed Cummings case diverge into two very different 
stories. The Secret Service would have you believe Ed 
Cummings is a malicious and dangerously vindictive phone 
phreaker. The hackers, phreakers and devotees of 2600 
magazine, who hold monthly meetings at locations nationwide 
would argue otherwise, saying that it's just that the Secret 
Service (or Secret Police as some hackers call them) is out to 
get Cummings. Side by side, the contentions hardly seem to 
relate to the same case and the same guy. Only after speaking 
with him myself, could I determine incontestably, that the Ed 
Cummings both sides were referring to was in fact one and the 
same person.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Who is Ed Cummings really, and why has he been 
incarcerated? When asked this exact question, he cautions 
that it's bad "etiquette" to question another prisoner for "what 
he's in for." He pauses for a moment and then laughs and says 
that he's "more than happy to speak about the case." In fact, 
Cummings says that at this point, he considers his life an open 
book, and he's just glad that someone is willing to listen to his 
side of the story. Emmanuel Goldstein, editor of 2600, and 
some other sympathizers have tried to exculpate Cummings of 
the allegations made against him by the U.S. Attorney's office, 
but mostly, he finds 
that the local press has badly misreported his case. So I ask 
him to tell me 
his story from the very beginning. He starts his tale on March 
13, 1995, the night local police officers confronted him 
outside the 7-11.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Call it bad timing, bad luck or bad karma -- one of the phone 
dialers Detective Morris seized from Cummings that night had 
been tampered with; Cummings says that it was a phone dialer 
he had sold to another hacker who later returned the device 
because of a flaky push button. Morris, the day after his initial 
encounter with Cummings, contacted First Bell Telephone, who 
then directed him to Special Agent Tom Varney of the Secret 
Service. Varney, who suspected that the device might be a 
"red box," an illegally modified tone dialer, went to meet Morris 
at the Haverford Police Department. "As soon as [Varney] 
walked in, he knew exactly what it was," Morris says. "We went 
over and used the red box on a pay phone, and it worked. We 
were getting free phone calls." Based on this evidence, 
Cummings was charged with a Pennsylvania misdemeanor two 
for possession of devices for theft of telecommunications and 
also with a felony for unauthorized access of a computer.<BR>

<IMG WIDTH=188 HEIGHT=254 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/buttons.gif" VSPACE=20 HSPACE=20>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The day after Cummings was arrested, he was shackled and 
led to the Haverford District Court for arraignment, where a bail 
agent set his bail at an unusually high $100,000. As it turns 
out, Cummings was supposed to be arraigned the previous 
night; however, the judge who was on duty at the time, Judge 
Gerald Liberace, knew Cummings personally (Ed was a friend of 
the family). So that following day, Cummings instead went 
before Judge David Lang, who arraigned him on the 
misdemeanor. Lang refused, however, to arraign him on the 
felony charge, stating that there was nothing in the affidavit 
accompanying the arrest warrant that said anything about 
"accessing a computer."<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thrown in an 8-by-5 foot holding cell at the Delaware County 
Prison, Cummings spent the next four days pondering his 
unexpected incarceration and making unwanted acquaintances 
with a few dazed loiterers who were in town for 
a Grateful Dead concert. Thereafter, he was transferred to "E 
Block" where he remained incarcerated, penniless and 
downcast, until his April 10 preliminary hearing. And that's 
when he recounts an unusual visit with his landlord, Al 
Wheatley. "I thought he 
was going to be mad as hell," says Cummings, who figured 
Wheatley had come to notify him of his eviction. To his 
surprise, however, Wheatley, an aspiring cyberlawyer, hoped to 
pick up the case, and agreed to waive any legal fees. For 
Cummings, it was a rare stroke of good luck.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On April 10 Cummings appeared in court for his preliminary 
hearing regarding his misdemeanor charge. And it was then 
that his case took a major turn for the worse. Before any 
charges were heard, Agent Varney and Detective Morris 
appeared in the courtroom and approached the bench. After a 
short discussion with the presiding judge, Judge Robert Burton, 
Cummings was informed that the state was dropping all 
charges against him -- but that the federal government was 
issuing a warrant for his arrest. Cummings was led out of the 
courtroom with three other prisoners and placed in a van that 
would once again return him to Delaware County Prison. As it 
pulled away from the courthouse, police and a number of 
Secret Service vehicles followed behind in tow. The parade of 
cars amazed and amused the other prisoners in the van. In a 
rare moment of levity, someone began singing the theme song 
to Secret Agent Man. Cummings joined in, but he couldn't help 
but wonder what it meant now that the U.S. Attorney's office 
would be handling his prosecution.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Before Cummings left for Fairton Federal Prison in New 
Jersey, his lawyer, Wheatley, visited him at the county prison 
and read him the federal charges. According to Wheatley, the 
violations didn't seem to exist, and he confessed that he 
couldn't find any trace of the federal statutes that Cummings 
had been charged with: <TT>Title 18, United States Code, Section 
1029 (a)(5)</TT> ("knowingly and with intent to defraud...possesses 
a telecommunications instrument that has been modified or 
altered to obtain unauthorized use of telecommunications 
services") and <TT>Section 1029 (a)(5)(B)</TT> ("knowingly and with 
intent to defraud...possesses hardware or software used for 
altering or modifying telecommunications instruments to obtain 
unauthorized access to telecommunications services").<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These phantom laws, it so happened, had been added as 
riders to the Digital Telephony Bill passed by Congress in late 
1994, only weeks before Cummings had been charged by the 
state, and weren't published in any law books yet. Cummings, 
as was his luck, would be the first person to be tried under 
these new federal statutes.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On April 26, Cummings was moved by Agent Varney from 
Delaware County Prison to federal court. Cummings describes 
the ride as uneventful but says that Varney was very curious 
about four photographs that had been found in his file cabinets 
at home -- all four were shots of Secret Service agents, one of 
which captured an agent "picking his nose."<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Cummings explained to Varney that he didn't take the shots 
himself but had received the four photos from a friend (who 
apparently sells electronics surveillance equipment to law 
enforcement agencies). "The Secret Service received an 
unfounded tip that one of his employees might have been 
involved in telecommunications fraud and sent two undercover 
agents to his place of business where they were captured on 
videotape," Cummings says. Suspecting that he was being 
investigated, Cummings' friend gave him the photos and asked 
that he bring them to a <I>2600</I> hacker meeting in Philadelphia 
to see if anyone could confirm his suspicions. Coincidentally, a 
camera crew from the Philadelphia Fox-TV affiliate, WTXF, was 
attending the meeting to film a short report on hacking. In an 
unfortunate twist, the four photos were broadcast on the 
evening news two nights later, causing an enormous 
embarrassment for the Secret Service.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Cummings is convinced to this day that this incident, and the 
subsequent discovery of the pictures in his home file cabinet, 
prompted Varney to recommend that the U.S. Attorney's office 
federally prosecute this case. Varney refutes the accusation 
and insists, "Ed Cummings was no more an interest than any 
other suspect or subject or mope or doer or perpetrator that I 
have ever investigated. It's just that Ed Cummings has become 
a martyr for the hacker community and the <I>2600</I> club, and so 
they see this as a vindictiveness and an aggressive reaction by 
the Secret Service."<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the federal arraignment later that April afternoon, the 
government referred to books on explosives and a substance 
resembling the explosive C4 that were found in Cummings' 
home. Despite the fact that there was nothing illegal about the 
possession of these bomb-making books, and regardless of the 
fact that the "C4" found in Cummings' home was nothing more 
than dental putty, the federal magistrate denied Cummings 
bail. By happenstance, Cummings' arraignment took place two 
hours after the entire federal building had to be evacuated 
because of a bomb scare and one week after the Oklahoma 
City bombing. The next afternoon, Cummings was denied bail 
and sent to federal prison.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Over the next couple of months, Wheatley, filed several 
appeals for bail, without success. Varney's testimony that two 
witnesses had claimed Cummings would flee if released was 
enough to convince any judge to deny bail. According to 
Cummings, however, the only person who actually made the 
claim that he would flee was a man named Charles Rappa, 
who previously had been arrested on assault charges (against 
Cummings). Frustrated by the evidence presented against him 
and also by his landlord lawyer's deleterious lack of experience 
with regard to the federal criminal justice system, Cummings 
fired Wheatley and scraped up enough money to hire attorney 
Ken Trujillo, a former federal prosecutor whom he discovered 
through a friend of a friend.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Trujillo, who began work on Cummings' case on July 7, 
immediately went after an inconsistency in a police report filed 
by Morris and a statement made in Varney's affidavit. In both 
documents, Morris and Varney wrote that the evidence taken 
from Ed Cummings on March 13 in front of the 7-11 was 
"confiscated." Trujillo's problem with the word "confiscated" 
was that there was no consent or probable cause to justify 
making the seizure of the phone dialers and phone crystals on 
Cummings' person, particularly since Morris didn't know what 
the parts were. In response to this inconsistency, Varney says, 
"[Morris] saw the fact that [Cummings] had a book opened up 
in regard to cloning cellular telephones, telecommunications 
fraud and red boxes. And in this book they opened up, they 
also cited Ed Cummings' business as the business that sold 
the parts to red boxes. I would guess that a law enforcement 
officer, with the type of experience that Detective Morris had, 
would be able to explain to any person why he felt there was 
criminal activity, that these items were involved in some sort of 
crime and that he was going to take them for further review. 
And I think he could persuade any judge to understand that."<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
On July 14, Trujillo filed a motion to suppress the evidence 
seized by Morris. It wasn't until Sept. 7, at the suppression 
hearing, that Judge Jay C. Waldman would hear and settle on 
the motion.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the meantime, Cummings recounts having spent many 
days in federal prison researching his own case and talking to 
and learning from other inmates about everything from stealing 
cars to making chemicals. At one point during his stay at 
Fairton, Cummings even tells of a run-in with Philadelphia 
crime 
boss, John Stanfa, who at the time was implicated in of the 
largest racketeering indictments in U.S. history.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the time of this "run-in," Cummings was sharing a cell with 
a roommate who had a penchant for bananas and who would 
smuggle them into their cell after meals. Irritated by the smell 
of discarded peels and the fruit flies they would attract, 
Cummings says he would pick them out of the trash each day 
and dump them instead in the communal bin just outside of 
the cell. One day during his ritual disposal of the peels, 
Cummings recalls lifting the 7-pound lid from off the communal 
can and balancing it precariously on a railing that ran the 
length of the upper tier. In a moment of clumsiness, he 
knocked the lid from off the railing and watched helplessly as it 
plummeted to the tier below, landing squarely on the large, 
bald head of Stanfa. Cummings immediately hurried to the tier 
below, spilling apology after apology over Stanfa's furious 
harangue of Sicilian curses. Thankfully one of Stanfa's 
bodyguards, in prison on a similar indictment as his boss, 
intervened and explained that Cummings, whom he had met a 
day before, was an "okay guy." Despite the bodyguard's 
intervention though, Cummings remained terrified at the 
prospect of donning cement boots. Two days later Stanfa 
confronted him again as he feared he might. But rather than 
"get rough" with him, the crime boss presented Cummings with 
an offer he couldn't refuse -- Stanfa's English wasn't terribly 
strong, so he asked Cummings to clean up a 50-page 
handwritten document outlining Stanfa's and his associates' 
alibis. In return for this favor, Cummings says he obtained 
prison protection and occasional favors.<BR>

<IMG WIDTH=136 HEIGHT=164 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/bernie.gif" VSPACE=20 HSPACE=20>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Just my strange luck, I 
suppose," Cummings says. "Things turned out all right, but 
imagine if I killed the guy by 
accident. Who would have believed me then?"<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Certainly not Judge Waldman, who, on Sept. 7, finally heard 
and denied Trujillo's motion to suppress the evidence of the 
phone dialers and crystals that were taken on March 13 
(Morris claimed that Cummings voluntarily gave him the 
evidence). With nowhere to go but down, Trujillo suggested to 
Cummings that he agree to a conditional guilty plea called a 
"Zudick plea." Since Ed was the first person to be tried under 
federal statutes <TT>1029(a)(5)</TT> and <TT>1029(a)(5)(B)</TT>, he could use 
the Zudick plea to challenge the constitutionality of the law he 
was accused of violating (and avoid the likely risk of being 
found guilty by a jury which often results in a harsher 
sentence). "It is unconstitutionally vague because given 
technology as it stands, the federal government has the wide 
ability to call virtually anything illegal under that law," Trujillo 
says.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 In a phone interview, a friend of Cummings (who wished to 
remain anonymous) adds, "It looks like it's possible to be guilty 
of this crime just by possessing a telephone because the 
telephone is self-modifying when you type buttons, because 
you can hit redial. So therefore, by owning a telephone, you're 
guilty of this crime." His back to the wall, and weary after seven 
months in jail, Cummings agreed to plead guilty.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The hacking community prayed, with Cummings, that the 
U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals would find the statutes 
under which 
he was being prosecuted unconstitutional; if not for the sake of 
their pal Bernie S. (he'd served his federal time anyway), then 
at least for their own sakes. Dark Tangent, an acquaintance of 
Cummings, who's known among hackers for his work organizing 
the yearly hacker convention, Def Con, says the fear among 
users with regard to this legislation is its vast potential to be 
abused. "I have parts laying all over my office that I'm sure I 
could cobble together and make all types of evil Îdeath 
machines.' I'm sure if I got a team of dedicated federal 
prosecutors in here, they could come up with a whole host of 
things to do with this stuff."<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Convinced, as is Ed, that the Secret Service was "out to do 
Cummings," Dark Tangent warns, "You don't really question the 
Secret Service, it's just not done."<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Finally on Oct. 10, 1995, after several unexplained hearing 
delays, Cummings received federal sentencing. It should be 
noted that the delays in Cummings' sentence caused him to 
serve an extra month in prison past the maximum federal 
guideline for a fraud case involving no money loss and no 
victims. This extra month served, says Cummings, was justified 
away that October afternoon when the court agreed to 
prosecuting attorney Anne Chain's request that his sentence be 
enhanced "because his offense involved 'more than minimal 
planning.'" This, even though, as Cummings insists, "all the 
'planning' alleged, the purchasing of crystals and dialers, 
occurred prior to the enactment of the statute I was charged 
with violating!" The sentence received: seven months 
imprisonment. Cummings, who had almost served the entire 
sentence during the protracted trial period, was released from 
federal custody three days later.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On Oct. 13, Cummings was finally released from prison. But, 
in a false ending typical of most bad horror stories, Cummings' 
short-lived freedom was only the calm before another 
nightmarish storm. Aside from the fact that the state had sold 
his impounded car, his federal conviction, as it turned out, was 
a violation of a county probation for a past misdemeanor 
charge, "tampering with evidence," that he pled "no contest" 
to in 1994. That earlier misdemeanor charge was the result of 
Cummings' 1993 encounter with Forks (Penn.) Township's 
police officer James Rowden at a Northampton County 
Summer HamFest (a kind of electronics show and flea market). 
Cummings, accompanied by two friends, Alan and Ted, had 
arrived at the HamFest at around 6 a.m., just before the gates 
to the show were opened. They parked Cummings' newly 
purchased Ford Thunderbird on the shoulder of a side road 
near the show and spent the next six hours buying electronic 
equipment at the festival. Upon returning to the car with 
armloads of assorted gear, they noticed a police car parked 
behind Cummings' vehicle. Rowden, a local policeman, had 
found the car abandoned on the side of the road and 
suspected that it had been stolen, particularly because one of 
the vehicle's windows was broken out and because its 
registration failed to match up. After making a procedural 
search through the glove box of the car (Cummings claims the 
search went "too far"), in an attempt to find some evidence of 
who the vehicle belonged to, Rowden says he discovered 
phone dialers and accompanying pamphlets that explained how 
to use them as red boxes.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rowden questioned Cummings about the car and explained 
that he couldn't allow the vehicle to be driven without proof of 
ownership and insurance. Unfortunately for Cummings, who 
had just purchased the Thunderbird that past week, he had not 
yet updated the registration plates for the vehicle and could 
provide no such proof. So Rowden drove the three show 
attendees to the police station where they could make phone 
calls to arrange for some kind of transportation back to 
Philadelphia. "I also explained to them about the phone dialers 
and that I would be contacting Bell Telephone security, and 
that they would be conducting an investigation," Rowden says. 
"[Cummings] was told he could take his personal belongings."<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Cummings, who admits that two of the six phone dialers that 
had been taken were red boxes, says that Rowden permitted 
them to leave with everything but the dialers. So one of his two 
friends (Cummings wouldn't say who)  grabbed the pamphlets 
and stuffed them down his pants, and removed the batteries 
from the phone dialers, effectively erasing the memory of 
illegally programmed red box tones. "Rowden did say everything 
but the phone dialers," Cummings explains.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
About 20 to 30 minutes after leaving the police station, while 
walking down a country road toward a bus station, Cummings 
says Rowden reappeared in his police vehicle and pulled over 
in front of them. Furious that the batteries had been removed 
from the dialers, Officer Rowden stepped out of the vehicle and 
told Cummings that someone would have to be held 
accountable for the tampering of evidence. Alan apparently 
was already on federal probation, says Cummings, "so I took 
the heat."<BR>

<IMG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=171 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/bars.gif" VSPACE=20 HSPACE=20>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Consequently, Cummings was placed on probation and 
slapped with his first misdemeanor two (a Pennsylvania charge 
that's equivalent in severity to scattering rubbish, insulting the 
flag or making a public nuisance). On Jan. 12 of this year, that 
seemingly minor charge would come back to haunt him in a big 
way.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Cummings' lawyer, Trujillo, whose car had been plowed under 
during that January morning's record blizzard, could not make it 
to his client's probation violation hearing. Angered by Trujillo's 
absence, Northampton County Judge Anthony Pinella forbid 
Cummings to speak in defense of himself; silent, Cummings 
listened intently as Agent Varney, Detective Morris and 
Cummings' probation officer, Scott Hoke, presented convincing 
evidence that hacker Bernie S. was a danger to the 
community. Despite the fact that he had landed a full-time job 
at Bell Atlantic as a technical assessor of computer problems 
(for banks, corporations, government agencies and ironically, 
the FBI), Judge Pinella returned Cummings to prison and set an 
extraordinary $250,000 cash bail.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With only a stick of gum and a little pocket change on him, 
Cummings certainly could not cover the enormous cash bail. 
He was placed once again in the all-too-familiar shackles, 
taken to Northampton County Prison and, thanks to the high 
bail setting, placed in the maximum security cellblock with "the 
23 most violent and dangerous inmates of the entire 520-man 
prison." It wasn't until March 5, 1996, that Cummings was 
finally sentenced by Judge Pinella for his probation violation: a 
$3,000 fine and two years in prison with eligibility for parole 
after six months. According to Trujillo, this was eight times the 
maximum guideline sentence for this kind of offense.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Currently, Cummings is being held at the minimum security 
wing of Bucks County Prison, the fifth prison he's had the 
misfortune of seeing from the inside. All this, he acknowledges 
with amazement, for the possession of a 486 laptop computer, 
a commercial software diskette with cellular programming 
utilities and two touch-tone dialers with 6.5MHz crystals 
installed. "There was never any charge of any damage incurred, 
because there wasn't any" he says in utter disbelief -- so the 
prosecution filed a charge of intent to defraud.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Prosecuting attorney Chain sharply disagrees that the 
Cummings case was merely about "intent." "There is a loss, it's 
just that you don't know what that exact amount is," she says. 
"Certainly, the potential for extensive losses is there...because 
we weren't required to put proof into specific dollar loss doesn't 
mean there wasn't loss, and that there wasn't harm."<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
But does that potential for loss equate to the loss of two 
years of a man's life? "Ed would try to convince you that he's 
as pure as the new driven snow, but unfortunately that is not 
the case," says Varney, who believes that, from the trunkloads 
of evidence found in Cummings' home, the punishment fits the 
crime.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Cummings laughs at the words, "trunkloads of evidence," 
and says that the "damaging" items Agent Varney introduced 
as evidence into court were guilefully exaggerated: lock-picking 
devices (just slim jims used for unlocking his car), the explosive 
C4 (in reality, dental putty), false identification documents (a 
novelty press badge that comically says "pull" on the back 
side). And the list goes on, as do the months in prison -- a year 
and seven months to date.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Still awaiting an ending is where Cummings' story stands 
today. On June 17, the U.S. Third District Court of Appeals 
dismissed his federal appeal. For hacker Bernie S., all that's 
left now is time to kill.
