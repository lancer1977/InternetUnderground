&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What do Liberace, Mr. T and Audrey Hepburn have in 
common?<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A taste for fine jewelry or a fondness for Shi Tzus? Perhaps, 
but more importantly these three celebrities share a <B>Bacon</B> 
number of two. That number is based on the theory that 
everyone who has ever appeared in a film is linked to <I>Footloose</I> 
star Kevin <B>Bacon</B>. <BR>

<IMG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=154 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="art/andkev.gif" VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The theory spawned the aptly titled Kevin <B>Bacon</B> Game that 
has movie fanatics trying to connect all of Hollywood to the 
<I>Flatliners,</I> star. While the game might not make the the next 
Olympics, it has definitely done more for the actor's career 
than <I>The Air Up There</I> ever did. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you haven't visited one of the dozen or so <B>Bacon</B> sites on 
the Web or crashed a college party recently, here's how the 
game works: 
Players try to connect any actor or actress to Kevin <B>Bacon</B> (who 
made his movie debut 
in 1978's <I>Animal House</I>), in as 
few steps as possible. For example, Marlon Brando was in <I>The 
Missouri Breaks</I> with Jack Nicholson, who co-starred with 
<B>Bacon</B> in <I>A Few Good Men</I>. That gives Brando the magic <B>Bacon</B> 
number of two.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Brett Tjaden and Glen Wasson,  both currently working toward 
their graduate degrees in computer science at the University of 
Virginia, created a site, The Oracle of <B>Bacon</B>, that once and for 
all proves that the <I>Tremors</I> star is the center of the 
entertainment universe.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<A HREF="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~bct7m/bacon.html">The Oracle (http://www.cs.
virginia.edu/~bct7m/bacon.html)</A> raids the massive <A HREF="http://www.imdb.com">Internet 
Movie Database (http://www.imdb.com)</A> site to instantly 
connect any actor with <B>Bacon</B>, the star of <I>The River Wild</I>. When 
it comes to the Game (alternately known as Six Degrees of 
Kevin <B>Bacon</B>), the Oracle is unshakable.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Most actors, living or dead, have a <B>Bacon</B> number of two or 
three. Tjaden and Wasson 
originally hypothesized that no one could possibly score a 
higher number than four, but Tjaden says the highest numbers 
hover around seven or eight. But unless you're a big fan of truly 
obscure actors -- Sri Lankan Grace Ariyawimal, for instance, has 
a <B>Bacon</B> number of seven -- it will take you hours to come up 
with even a four. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The site's averaging 20,000 
visitors a day, with many surfersf inding themselves instantly 
addicted. Office workers and students often crowd around one 
terminal and frantically type in the names of obscure actors, in 
hopes of  stumping the Oracle. Tjaden says that 
he never expected all of this attention.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"We originally intended it to be for just the two of us," says 
Tjaden, 26. "Then we told a couple of friends, who had 
graduated and left school, about it. Word got out and pretty 
soon more people were using it. After the site had been up for 
about a week or two, all of a sudden it was Yahoo's pick of the 
week and that just brought absolutely everybody. It went big-time 
very fast."<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The pair receive 10-20 e-mails a day about the site and say 
that the reaction has been "very positive." Not only has the 
'net community been visiting the site, but Hollywood has taken 
notice as well. Attaining his 15 minutes of fame, Tjaden was 
flown out to Los Angeles in July to appear in a segment for the 
Discovery Channel's <I>Cyberlife</I>. While he was in California, 
Tjaden became the envy of <B>Bacon</B>-heads everywhere when he 
met the star in person. Before the cameras and without his 
computer, Tjaden played a round of the <B>Bacon</B> game with 
<B>Bacon</B>.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"I had heard that he thought of the game as making fun of 
him," Tjaden says. "But he was very nice to me and said he 
was very happy with it and impressed. I complimented him on 
<I>Footloose</I> and he said, 'Well, thank you, but I've done other 
movies since then.'"<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"To be perfectly honest," Tjaden says, "I haven't seen more 
than two or three of his movies."
After reaching the "highest plateau" of <B>Bacon</B>-dom, Tjaden 
says that he and Wasson don't enjoy the game as much as 
they 
once did.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Whenever anybody hears about this, the first thing they want 
to do is challenge me," Tjaden says. "I am still playing the 
game, but not much for fun anymore with Glenn."<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nonetheless, Tjaden says he doesn't have any regrets.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"When we first started to do this we had 
no aspirations other than to make it for 
ourselves," he says. "When other people 
found it interesting we were perfectly happy 
if they wanted to use it. When we first 
started, we joked that if this ever led 
to meeting Kevin (<I>She's Having A Baby</I>) <B>Bacon</B> that would be 
the ultimate. We have accomplished all that we can hope to 
accomplish with this."
