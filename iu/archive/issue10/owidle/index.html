&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the beginning of 
modern sketch comedy came Monty Python.  This band of Brits 
with a nonsensical name took television and twisted it to their 
own skewed sense of silliness, redefining comedy and setting 
the stage for a thousand copycat acts. It should come as no 
surprise, then, that the Web would fall prey to Python humor 
faster than an African swallow: It is, after all, the next great 
frontier, and Python has already left its mark on every other 
entertainment genre. Now it's their turn to take that silliness to 
the Web through <A HREF="http://www.pyth
online.com">PythOnline (www.pyth
online.com)</A>. Though the site was the brainchild of Eric Idle, all 
of the remaining Pythons (John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry 
Jones and Terry Gilliam) are contributing with a fervor you might 
not expect from a group that's now scattered across the globe. 
And it's not that the troupe lacks things to do -- all by his 
lonesome, Idle, not only heads up the Web site, but he devotes 
an enormous amount of time to Python's plentiful CD-ROMs. 
He also recently wrapped a role in a film directed by Jones for 
Disney and finished a children's book due out this fall. IU 
caught up with Idle to ask how he and his compatriots plan to 
Pythonize the Web.

Where did the initiative for 
PythOnline come from?

Eric Idle:</B><BR> It came from me, and it came about 18 months ago 
when I was scanning the 'net and did a search for Monty 
Python. I stopped when I got 1,034 replies -- I was completely 
bowled over and amazed.  So I went and looked around some 
of the sites. I thought they were very good and very interesting, 
but I thought, you know what would be really great? To have a 
real Python site, rather than a fanzine-type-based one, which is 
just trying to be serious about this. It would be great to have a 
non-fanzine-type-site which is pure Python, more like the 
books.  I began to envision sort of an interactive 
book/magazine-type site, and I came up with the name 
PythOnline. I figured it would be great to link to all these other 
Python sites, so they could just all have a central base where 
we were sort of available, or they could get real serious 
questions answered that they wanted to ask, or we could just 
put up silly stuff. I'd always in the back of my mind wanted to 
be with 7th Level, because I was doing the <I>Holy Grail</I> CD-ROM 
at the same time, and I love them all there -- they're so silly 
and loony, it's one of the nicest silly companies I've ever 
worked with.

IU:</B><BR> So, assuming they're the ones doing the programming, 
what's your role been with it?
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- -->

<TABLE BGCOLOR=F4F9A3 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
EI:</B><BR> I run around and give them ideas and material. I'm acting 
as sort of an editor or Webmaster 
or something. I provide them with the material and all the 
ideas, and they back me up with artists and programmers and 
the know-how. We're playing with a new thing called Top Gun, 
which 7th Level has developed, which enables us to actually 
have live games on the site, one of which is Drop the Cow, 
from the new <I>Grail</I> (CD-ROM). You have to avoid the 
cow landing on your head.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- -->

<TABLE BGCOLOR=CAE8E8 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
IU:</B><BR> So was there a similar 
beginning behind the CD-ROMs? The Pythons always 
seem to be on the cutting edge of technology.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- -->

<TABLE BGCOLOR=F4F9A3 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
EI:</B><BR> Absolutely. And what's great about it is the people in that 
new technology, they're all Python fans. It makes a natural 
marriage.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- -->

<TABLE BGCOLOR=CAE8E8 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
IU:</B><BR> Why do you think that is? 
Why do you think that technology 
people are so attracted to 
Monty Python?
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- -->

<TABLE BGCOLOR=F4F9A3 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
EI:</B><BR> I think because it's bright, and yet it's silly. I don't know -- 
what really amazed me was that almost everybody with a 
computer was a Python fan. It's like the Rolling Stones and 
Monty Python. The very phrase "spamming" the net comes 
from Python. I don't know why that is -- I'm not a psychologist 
but I just observed that it is true, and that means that it's worth 
doing -- entertaining with silly things -- because a lot of people 
are out there waiting for it.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- -->

<TABLE BGCOLOR=CAE8E8 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
IU:</B><BR> Are the other Pythons 
contributing?
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- -->

<TABLE BGCOLOR=F4F9A3 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
EI:</B><BR> Very much so. I've badgered them and bullied them and e-mailed them constantly. We have a lot of new art from Terry 
Gilliam, because he's scrawling all the time, and he's very 
much set the tone of the look of the Web site, which is very 
much black and white, because everyone else is using massive 
color, so we'll avoid that. He's done these wonderful line 
drawings, and I've gotten a lot of material from Terry Jones, 
and some
lectures from Cleese -- some very silly stuff from him. Michael 
Palin's at the moment halfway around China, and will be 
coming through in July, and we'll grab him then. He's been 
going around the Pacific Rim.

IU:</B><BR> That's his new tour?
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- -->

<TABLE BGCOLOR=F4F9A3 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
EI:</B><BR> Exactly. So we'll grab him and he'll provide some stuff too.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<TABLE BGCOLOR=CAE8E8 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
IU:</B><BR> What do they think of the technology? Are they as 
computer literate as you are, or are you kind of ahead of 
the curve?
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- -->

<TABLE BGCOLOR=F4F9A3 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
EI:</B><BR> Two of them are. I mean, Jones is very computer literate. 
He sent me some photographs (over the 
computer) the other day, which I thought was very impressive.  
Gilliam is in England, and it's always frustrating in England, 
because it's there, but it doesn't really work properly. That's 
why I love living here, in the States, because the toys are all 
here, and you can get them sooner, and they're not closed for 
the weekend, or the month of July, like they are in Europe. But 
Cleese is not very technologically inclined and Michael sort of 
seems to be against it.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- -->

<TABLE BGCOLOR=CAE8E8 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
IU:</B><BR> Actively against it?
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- -->

<TABLE BGCOLOR=F4F9A3 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
EI:</B><BR> Even using a pencil. But I'd like to send him off on a 
worldwide trek on the 'net. I'd like to see him go online and I've 
been trying to persuade him to do that. He's a bit frightened of 
it, but we'll get him there.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- -->

<TABLE BGCOLOR=CAE8E8 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
IU:</B><BR> You mentioned a little bit of what the site is going to 
be about. Can you go into how you're going to keep it 
kinetic?
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- -->

<TABLE BGCOLOR=F4F9A3 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
EI:</B><BR> Well, we're going to use animation a lot, and if you 
download Top Gun you'll get into a much more active site. I'd 
like to explore ways of making people laugh, really, and see 
how much you can involve them. In many ways we've taken the 
attitude that "Look, there's not much out there to laugh at." 
What I would like to do is play a lot of gags on people as they 
log on, and we're getting into that. Still, the technology is just 
<IMG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=182 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="art/idle.gif" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>lagging behind. It's painful for me sometimes that it takes so 
long  to get the gag up -- I want to hit 'em on the head now. So 
half the time I'm just trying to get it faster from 7th Level's 
Headquarters.  But I really like making up the form of the 
material as well as the content. In other words, when we have 
the Queen online, you feel she's in the chatroom, that she's 
actually there. Now that's a new joke -- nobody's done that sort 
of a joke before and I love that.

</TD></TR></TABLE>



<TABLE BGCOLOR=CAE8E8 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
IU:</B><BR> It seems that with the Web, there's no set way to be 
funny.
</TD></TR></TABLE>



<TABLE BGCOLOR=F4F9A3 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
EI:</B><BR> But that's exciting. Nobody's done it before. You have this 
whole blank sheet of paper. It's sort of equivalent to when we 
got into television -- we could just play with the toys. And that's 
where we are now. I'm hopeful that we'll get the Pythons 
contributing from wherever they are, which is the other great 
thing -- no matter where you are in the world, you can play 
along. Once we have the site up and running, they can log in 
and do whatever they want.

with the site, and trying to do comedy this way?
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- -->

<TABLE BGCOLOR=F4F9A3 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
EI:</B><BR> I think that it's all a challenge, but none of it's difficult 
because it's all never been done before, and that makes it 
exciting. Every day we make up new stuff. We say, what shall 
we do? Well, how about if we do this? How can we amuse 
them, tease them, please them. I really like it -- it's the most 
fun I've had since we first went into television.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- -->

<TABLE BGCOLOR=CAE8E8 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
IU:</B><BR> So how long have you been on the 'net and how did 
you 
initially get involved with it?
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- -->

<TABLE BGCOLOR=F4F9A3 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
EI:</B><BR> A friend of mine, Stephen Fry, has a page which he was 
very keen on showing me about a year and a half ago. But 
what's nice for me is working with a high-tech company, so 
instead of having just a homemade Web page, you have all the 
real big toys. You can say "give me some challenges. What can 
I really do?" And that's the great fun of working with 7th Level 
on this. Plus the other great advantage of the Web is that we 
have a lot of Python shit, like Grail calendars, and datebooks, 
and very nice, cool T-shirts and Spam mugs and it's a great 
way to show people. Whenever they come to our houses or see 
us, they're like "Where'd you get that?  I want that!" And it's 
very hard to get that all to work, because some of it's made in 
Australia, and some of it's in Germany. But with the Web, you 
can say, "Well look, you can just click and order, and we'll send 
it to you."
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- -->

<TABLE BGCOLOR=CAE8E8 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
IU:</B><BR> So have you surfed around much and seen anything 
else?
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- -->

<TABLE BGCOLOR=F4F9A3 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
EI:</B><BR> I've been so busy, I haven't. I basically use the Web to tell 
me when soccer's on American television. Unfortunately there's 
no cricket on American television, but I'm hopeful. I use it to 
find out the cricket scores in England. And I use my computer a 
lot as a writing tool -- I have for four or five years. But the fun 
I'm having now is actually pulling up Gilliam animation stuff and 
playing with it. You know, going into Paintshop and putting text 
on it...just generally creating.  It's the same as when I was 
editor of the Python books. Basically you took the Python stuff 
and you'd say, how would it work in book form? Now, it's really 
a matter of taking all this stuff that people don't know about, 
that's obscure and weird and still funny, and putting it into this 
new form to see if we can entertain them and make them 
laugh.

<TABLE BGCOLOR=CAE8E8 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
IU:</B><BR> But you have been using e-mail for a while.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- -->

<TABLE BGCOLOR=F4F9A3 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
EI:</B><BR> I love e-mail. It's the only mail I like. I hate post offices. I 
have a fear of post offices, and it isn't just American post 
offices where you can get killed by disgruntled former 
employees -- I think there's something about people that work 
in post offices that daunts the customer. They're not customer 
friendly. I love writing letters and I've always loved writing 
letters, and what's great is to be able to write things, hit send, 
and "bang!" It's gone.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- -->

<TABLE BGCOLOR=CAE8E8 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>

sites?
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- -->

<TABLE BGCOLOR=F4F9A3 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
EI:</B><BR> I only did that once and it's not a good idea.  Although we 
will have a site, I think, where people can ask questions as 
long as it doesn't go nuts.

<TABLE BGCOLOR=CAE8E8 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>

IU:</B><BR> I'd imagine, with the number of Monty Python fans on

wouldn't want to open.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<TABLE BGCOLOR=F4F9A3 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
EI:</B><BR> We had 160,000 hits before we opened. My instinct that 
they were out there and wanted it is being borne out. They do 
want entertainment, and they do want to laugh and nobody's 
playing with this toy. I love being there at the beginning.

<TABLE BGCOLOR=CAE8E8 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>

</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- -->

<TABLE BGCOLOR=F4F9A3 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
EI:</B><BR> Oh yeah, I've gone to the fan sites. Not all of them, cause 
there are over a thousand of them, but we'll link to the best 
ones. We give them mention so fans can come through us and 
go on to these sites.  But we're not really into the fan stuff 
quite as much as the fans are -- I mean, we don't say how cute 
we all are. We go the other way.

</TD></TR></TABLE>

<!-- -->

<TABLE BGCOLOR=F4F9A3 BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH=490>
<B>
EI:</B><BR> I think it's amazement and then gratitude. Of course, if you 
all sent a penny we could all have a golden retirement. We'll 
see if we can make it pay -- that's the challenge.

up as we go along.

<B>
EI:</B><BR> Somebody showed it to me the other day. It was hysterical. 
We chose it as our site of the week, and it's just wonderful. 
When we told him we were going to feature it, he said he was 
going to make another site called "Eric Idle Visited My Web 
Site." It would just be disappearing into infinity. But I like that -- 
we're encouraging people to come and nominate silly sites, 
and things they've found. There will be message boards, a 
Swedish Message Board and all that sort of thing, plus humor. 
Humor, information -- anything to keep people exchanging on a 
bright level.
