<B>Early in October</B>, after a hard day of surfing, I came across <A HREF="http://www.rodney.com"> 
http://www.rodney.com</A>, a site dedicated to the work and life of Rodney Dangerfield. Initially, I 
assumed this was a fan site, except that a couple of elements, like correspondence between 
<IMG WIDTH=162 HEIGHT=180 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/rodney.gif" VSPACE=15 HSPACE=15>
Rodney and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, seemed like tough artifacts for a 
fan to scrape up. Figuring this was a lot of effort for a Rodney enthusiast to go through, I dropped 

the site some e-mail. Less than a day later I got a note back -- yes, this was really Rodney; yes, 
he does his own Web page; and yes, he's getting RealAudio for all those .wav files of his Joke of 
the Day. Finding a celebrity who not only knows about the Web but actually participates, 
especially at age 73, is quite a rarity. So <I>IU</I> decided to talk to Rodney about his experience 
in cyberspace and answer the ultimate question: Could the star of <I>Caddyshack</I>, <I>Easy 
Money</I> and <I>Back to School</I> at least find some respect on the Web?
<P>

<FONT COLOR=97D207><B>Internet Underground:</FONT COLOR=97D207></B> What projects are you working on right now in real life? Can you tell us a little 
about the film you're currently shooting? 

<P>
<FONT COLOR=C7282C><B>Rodney Dangerfield:</FONT COLOR=C7282C></B> I'm excited about my new talking book, La Contessa, where I reveal my torrid 
love affairs and also about my new movie, Meet Wally Sparks, about a scandalous talk show host.  
Burt Reynolds and Cindy Williams are in it and cameos are made by Michael Bolton, Jay Leno, Bob 
Saget, Tony Danza and Ron Jeremy.

<FONT COLOR=97D207><B>IU:</FONT COLOR=97D207></B> What was your first experience with computers?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=C7282C><B>RD:</FONT COLOR=C7282C></B> I thought, "Wow, who invented this?"  Then, I pulled a muscle downloading.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=97D207><B>IU:</FONT COLOR=97D207></B> How did you get interested in the Internet and cyberspace?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=C7282C><B>RD:</FONT COLOR=C7282C></B> My wife showed me and I thought it was wild.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=97D207><B>IU:</FONT COLOR=97D207></B> How long has your Web site been up and who designed it? Who created  your screen saver?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=C7282C><B>RD:</FONT COLOR=C7282C></B> I launched it in March.  I decided the kind of stuff I wanted up there and had some help designing 
it from my wife and some computer guys at HLC-Internet and an independent consultant named Ken 
Johnson.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=97D207><B>IU:</FONT COLOR=97D207></B> Does having a Web site allow you to show more of your personality than more traditional media? What part of your site do you think best defines you as a person as well as an entertainer?
<P> 
<FONT COLOR=C7282C><B>RD:</FONT COLOR=C7282C></B> Since it's my own personal site, I can say whatever I want and talk about my side of the story with the Academy rejecting me and AT&T saying I'm not dignified enough to represent them. Whatever I 
want to talk about... sort of a soapbox, I guess.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=97D207><B>IU:</FONT COLOR=97D207></B> How much e-mail do you get? Do your fans actually believe that it's you? Are people surprised that you have a 'net presence?
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=119 HEIGHT=64 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/smithso.gif" VSPACE=15 HSPACE=15>
<FONT COLOR=C7282C><B>RD:</FONT COLOR=C7282C></B> People are surprised, and when I do answer, sometimes they write again and say "Only the real 
Rodney would answer like that," and other times they don't think it's me at all.  I get hundreds of letters 
a day and pick out some good ones to answer.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=97D207><B>IU:</FONT COLOR=97D207></B> Has being on the Internet and having e-mail given you any new jokes or material for your routine, 
and if so, what are they?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=C7282C><B>RD:</FONT COLOR=C7282C></B> One guy sent me a joke I liked. I bought it from him, but it's too dirty to quote here.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=97D207><B>IU:</FONT COLOR=97D207></B> Do you e-mail other celebrities? What is the general Hollywood reaction to cyberspace? 
<P>
<FONT COLOR=C7282C><B>RD:</FONT COLOR=C7282C></B> I've sent messages to a few and they never answered back. 
I can't speak for "general Hollywood," but I'm still learning my way around cyberspace. It's all new to 
me, too.
<P>

<FONT COLOR=97D207><B>IU:</FONT COLOR=97D207></B> What are your favorite Web sites? 
<P>
<FONT COLOR=C7282C><B>RD:</FONT COLOR=C7282C></B> I like the idea of Virtual Vegas and RealAudio. And I'll give my wife a plug: visit her site at 
jungleroses.com.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=97D207><B>IU:</FONT COLOR=97D207></B> What's the weirdest e-mail you've ever gotten?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=C7282C><B>RD:</FONT COLOR=C7282C></B> Someone sent a pornographic photo once in response to something I said through e-mail. At the 
time, I didn't know you could send photos so it came as a real surprise.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=97D207><B>IU:</FONT COLOR=97D207></B> Where is your computer set up and what does the surrounding environment look like?
<P> 
<FONT COLOR=C7282C><B>RD:</FONT COLOR=C7282C></B> My computer sits on the credenza behind my desk. The microphone for the computer is propped 
up on a comedy award statue. All this is in my living room. My wife decorated the whole place.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=97D207><B>IU:</FONT COLOR=97D207></B> Even in this new medium, 
do you still get no respect?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=C7282C><B>RD:</FONT COLOR=C7282C></B> No respect at all, are you kiddin'?  I never had any luck with computers. I bought an Apple. It had 
a worm in it!
