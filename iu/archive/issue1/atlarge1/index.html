		<B>People at the grocery store don't 
		recognize me.</B>  No one points at me when I
		walk down the street.  When I introduce
        myself at a party, ears don't perk up. I guess that's life as a Web celebrity.
      Recently, I was lounging in my expensive, new bathrobe, watching workers install another bunk on 
my bed when I realized: There is room for more people like me. Even the least popular show on 
network television has more viewers than the most popular page on the Web. The Web community is 
small. It's easy to become notorious or famous on the Web. Anyone can be a celebrity in the virtual 
world.

For example, this guy doesn't qualify. (<A HREF="http://www.usl.edu/Departments/CACS/

<FONT SIZE=4>2.</FONT SIZE=4> BE CREATIVE, ORIGINAL 
AND OWN A COMPUTER. <BR>
</B></FONT COLOR=079294>
Although, it only really matters if you own a computer.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=079294><B>
<FONT SIZE=4>3.</FONT SIZE=4> THINK UP A NAME FOR YOURSELF.<BR>
</B></FONT COLOR=079294>
I chose Mirsky. You might want to choose something else. Some suggestions: Bronsky, Ballsky, 
Flopsky or Tursky.

NEED TO BE A REAL PERSON.

<FONT COLOR=079294><B>
<FONT SIZE=4>5.</FONT SIZE=4> CREATE YOUR OWN PAGE.<BR>
</FONT COLOR=079294></B>
It doesn't need to be special or interesting. For example, you might want to create a page about 
lozenges. Show different kinds of lozenges. Time how long they last and describe which ones taste 
best. Maybe explain "menthol." Do it soon, though -- do you have any idea how many people will read 
this column?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=079294><B>
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<FONT SIZE=4>6.</FONT SIZE=4> GET AS MANY LINKS TO 
YOUR SITE AS YOU CAN.<BR>
</FONT COLOR=079294></B>
It's expensive, but you might want to give away a car. A few months ago, I entered an online contest 
and won a nice, insulated cup. If you can't give away any merchandise, offer sex. Promote it by saying 
your page has "more nudity than humanly possible." That should get people to look at it.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=079294><B>

<FONT SIZE=4>7.</FONT SIZE=4> GARNER AS MANY 
WEB AWARDS AS POSSIBLE.<BR>
</FONT COLOR=079294></B>
Here are some of them:  Funky Site of the Day
<A HREF="http://www.realitycom.com/cybstars/index.html">http://www.realitycom.com/cybstars/index.html</A>; Fred's Web Hotspots, 
<A HREF="http://www.winmag.com/flanga/hotspots.htm">http://www.winmag.com/flanga/hotspots.htm</A>; Mexico Cool Site of the Day 
<A HREF="http://dch.mty.itesm.mx/cool/">http://dch.mty.itesm.mx/cool/</A>.
<P>
	When  you've been named Barbara's Best Bookmark of the Day 
<A HREF="http://www.shsu.edu/users/std/stdkco/pub2/best.html">http://www.shsu.edu/users/std/stdkco/pub2/best.html</A>, you know that
CNN can't be far behind. Display all awards, no matter how obscure.

<FONT SIZE=4>8.</FONT SIZE=4> GET A REAL CELEBRITY TO ENDORSE YOUR PAGE.<BR>

This is hard. So far, Erik Estrada will not return my calls.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=079294><B>
<FONT SIZE=4>9.</FONT SIZE=4> THINK LIKE A CELEBRITY.<BR>
</FONT COLOR=079294></B>
This is the most important aspect of becoming a Web celebrity.  Although advertisers claim that 
millions of people use the Web, only a few thousand ever read a particular Web page on a given day. 
You are more likely to become famous by writing an editorial in your local paper. To become a 
celebrity on the Web, it's thus imperative that you forget that your audience is small.
You must act and think like you are world-renown. To take on that indifferent air that makes celebrities 
so attractive, do the following:<BR>
<OL>
	<LI> Don't answer e-mail.
	<LI> Make people read a lot of reviews of your 
	site before they can actually see it.
	<LI> Make graphics of your name huge and appear everywhere
</OL>

<FONT SIZE=4>10.</FONT SIZE=4> ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF BEING A WEB CELEBRITY.<BR>
</FONT COLOR=079294></B>
It's hard for me to determine the benefits of being a Web celebrity. Once, I got e-mail from Courtney 
Love. Oh yeah, I almost forgot. 
I also got to write this column even though I really don't what 
the hell I'm talking about.
