<P>
<B>When the NBA, with the help of Starwave, launched its massive commercial</B> site last fall, the general 
reaction was pure adulation. The arbiters of cool on the Web tripped over each other to praise the league's 
official collection of news and stats in NBA.com. In the spirit of full disclosure, I should note even <i>IU</i> included 
the site in its vaunted Top 10.
<P>
	But basketball fanatic Christopher Cote greeted the arrival of an official NBA site with a much different 
reaction: "It blows, it sucks... it was such a letdown. I was 
so bummed, it was so weak." 
<P>
	You'll have to excuse him for being somewhat biased. Cote is the co-creator of the site On Hoops at <A HREF="http://www.onhoops.com/">http://www.onhoops.com/</A>, best described as the evil twin of NBA.com.
<P>

	Where the NBA site highlights superstars in a straightforward, if somewhat sterile style, On Hoops offers 
"Police Blotter," chronicling the missteps of NBA rank-and-file, replete with icons of bongs, moonshine jugs 
and boxing gloves. 
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=159 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/hoops.gif" VSPACE=7 HSPACE=7>
	It's not that Cote and his partner Brock Andersen don't like the NBA. You need only wander their site to 
find out what big fans they are of the sport. On Hoops features in-depth game analysis, detailed examinations 
of trades and signings and explorations of team trends. Cote and Andersen, both 23, leave the mundane daily 
reporting to the professionals. 
<P>
	   "At NBA.com, there's not much there," says Andersen, "I'd rather read the box scores in the paper and 
I've already seen all the great plays on ESPN by the time they are on the Web." 
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=83 HEIGHT=57 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/bbox.gif" VSPACE=7 HSPACE=7>
	Only two basketball fanatics such as Cote and Andersen could engineer a site that examines all facets of the 
game, sometimes taking the time to talk about forgotten arts of passing and shooting in these days when the 
dunk reigns supreme. They are quick to praise those who are worthy, but it's open season on the NBA's 
crybabies, malcontents and prima donnas.
<P>
	"The popularity of our site?" Cote ponders, "There's no crap to it. If a guy plays like a dog we call him a 
dog. I'm a fan of the game more than individual teams. Hitting the open man, running a good break. That's 
what I love seeing."
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=82 HEIGHT=83 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/gloves.gif" VSPACE=7 HSPACE=7>
	The pair refer to themselves on the site as Los Chucks, derived from a slang term for their style of play. Los 
Chucks work by day at Vidya Media Ventures, a contract Web publisher they founded along with four other 
college friends. The pair started On Hoops when it became clear their co-workers were sick of hearing the two 
always talking about basketball. The two were screwing around with the computer one night and On Hoops 
was born.
<P>
	At first, Cote says, they were lucky to get 100 hits a month, but you can't hide good content on the Web. 
Cote says now On Hoops averages 120,000 hits a week, a remarkable number for a non-commercial site. 
Success has its benefits; at press time, Los Chucks were in the midst of negotiating with a couple of commercial 
online services to become content providers. They've also put out the word via their site that they are open to 
sponsorship. 
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=65 HEIGHT=75 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/gun.gif" VSPACE=7 HSPACE=7>
	The ideas for their site just come 
to them impulsively. Police Blotter 
was started when Cote was in bed reading about the Cleveland Cavaliers' Tyrone Hill and the Sacramento 
Kings' Brian Grant altercation with some Cincinnatians.
<P>
	With Andersen still finishing up school at the University of California at San Diego while working and Cote 
pulling in 13-hour days, neither has much of a chance to do recreational Web browsing. Cote says maintaining 
the site takes about an hour a day, and he refuses to work on the weekends -- unless there's a really big story. 
<P>
	In addition to sharing the writing and editing, Cote puts together all 
the graphics for the site, as well design for  other Vidya clients. Andersen's 'net knowledge was limited before 
On Hoops started. "For me it just kind of started as a hobby," he says, "it was a way to learn the programming 
language."
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=65 HEIGHT=70 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/jug.gif" VSPACE=7 HSPACE=7>
	Both Andersen and Cote say e-mail from readers pleases them most, especially those who have started to 
contribute articles to the site. Beyond offering stories, visitors help On Hoops expand by nominating players to 
two of the more popular areas: The Journeyman/Chump Roster highlighting the "Masters of the 10-day 
contract, league minimum plus meal money" and The Golden Chuck Awards where the awards range from the 
"The Bolted to the Floor Chuck" to "The Acie Earl Ugliest Skills Chuck." 
<P>
	Don't look for Los Chucks to diversify any time soon. "We don't like football very much," Cote says, "and 
baseball puts me to sleep by the second inning."
