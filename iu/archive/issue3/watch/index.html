    The jewel thief altered his name, his city
 and even his gender. But he couldn't erase
 his online persona. 
    Unfortunately for the fugitive, Joseph
 Seanor was on his trail.
    Seanor is one of those folks you don't want
 after you if you're trying to cover your
 tracks through cyberspace. He's someone you do
 want on your side if you've got a person you'd
 like to track down. And if he's learned one
 thing from his years of being a professional
 snoop, it's this: Most people have no idea how
 to hide. 
    Yeah, they try to cut all ties with their
 old self, but they always fall back on some
 routine. They always join the same health
 club. Or always eat lunch at McDonald's. Or
 hit Taco Bell for an exciting night on the
 town every Friday.
    They do the same thing online, too. In the
 movie The Net, Sandra Bullock was trying to
 hide from a mysterious hacker syndicate, but
 the minute she got her hands on a computer
 keyboard she flew right back to the exact
 same chat channel where she always would hang
 out and went for help to CyberBob? Of course,
 the hackers were watching, so within a matter
 of hours CyberBob suffered an unfortunate
 brain dump all over his parquet floor. 
 Bullock managed to escape the hackers'
 clutches by fleeing through a merry-go-round
 on the Santa Monica Pier.
    Well, folks, that convenient merry-go-
 round isn't always so handy in real life. At
 least it wasn't there for the guy Seanor
 tracked down. 
    The fellow was in his late 20s, the son
 of a well-heeled East Coast family -- and a
 transsexual desperate for a sex-change
 operation. One day, after he'd been living
 as a woman for a while, he simply vanished.
 A week later, his mother noticed some others
 things were missing: her diamond necklace,
 a ring and a tennis bracelet.
    The mother assumed her son wanted to sell
 the jewels to help pay for his operation.
 She didn't want to call the cops; she just
 wanted to talk to him. But where was he? He
 left no forwarding address, just a stack of
 old e-mail from a bunch of electronic
 bulletin boards.
    Enter Seanor. He's president of the CIBIR
 Corporation, a D.C.-area company that
 specializes in high-tech investigations, and
 a fixture of the online private-eye scene.
 From his previous career doing "analysis"
 for "the government" (that's as specific as
 he'll get -- draw your own conclusions), he
 knew how to scan the e-mail for clues. In
 virtual life as well as the real thing
 "humans are creatures of habit," Seanor says.
 "They'll use very crude and lewd names, or
 they'll always have a number in their 
 name or their name will begin with 'A.' 
 One person might be addicted to lowercase
 letters and goofy slang. Another might end
 every posting with the same Lou Barlow lyric.
    The person Seanor was tracking always
 ended his screen name with the same word,
 signing in as something like "Crystal Blue" 
 on one BBS, or "Indigo Blue" on another.
    Seanor figured the guy was still online
 somewhere.  So Seanor searched Yahoo for a
 listing of alternative lifestyle BBSs
 around the country, then painstakingly
 subscribed to about 200 of them. He wrote
 a script to log on to each one and download
 a list of users. After four months, he
 found a name that fit the pattern on a
 bulletin board in San Francisco. Better
 yet, other e-mail clues fit, too. 
    Best of all, the person had left a phone
 number. 
    Seanor spun the number through a
 national phone directory on CD-ROM. That
 gave him an address. Then he ran the
 address through another  commercial
 database, CDB/Infotek, just to make sure.
 After that, he had another investigator
 make a visit to the home. 
	"It was the guy," Seanor says
 triumphantly. Or by that point, girl. She
 had gone through the sex change and adopted
 a new identity on the other side of the
 country from her old home. Just one thing 
 tripped her up. If she would have stayed off
 the bulletin boards, Seanor says, "it would
 have been 100 times harder."


GIGABYTE GUMSHOES

 Not all private investigators are as 'net-
 savvy as Seanor, who spends up to 150 hours
 a month strapped into a pair of virtual
 reality goggles (he says they're easier on
 his eyes than staring at a monitor). But the
 Internet is rapidly becoming a crucial part
 of the PI's tool kit. If The Rockford Files 
 were filmed today, the show might just start
 with viewers checking out Jim's e-mail
 instead of his answering machine. Though,
 he'd probably still get the crap beaten out
 of him each time he went home to his trailer.
    Some investigators use the 'net as a place
 to hang out, gossip with other private eyes
 or try to market their services with pages on
 the Web. Others use it as a reference library
 to translate ZIP codes or track down
 Securities and Exchange Commission documents.
 A smaller number live and work in cyberspace,
 trailing hackers and sniffing out black
 markets of cor  porate data. 
    Of course, computers are nothing new to
 P.I.s. They've had online access for years to
 companies that sell vast stores of data on
 just about everyone: credit reports,
 addresses, unlisted phone numbers, Social
 Security numbers, marriage and divorce
 documents, names of neighbors, criminal
 histories, driving records, shopping habits,
 hobbies, medical data, property values, even
 minutiae like height and eye color. In many
 communities, data traditionally available
 only on paper, such as liens and county court 
 dockets, are just a modem and a mouse click
 away. And that's just the stuff you can get
 legally.  
    "At least 95 percent of the investigations
 I do use an online source of some sort," says
 Richard Mauzy, an investigator who runs the
 Public Integrity Research Corp. in Gilbert,
 Ariz. "It's been basically a revolutionary
 change. 
    The 'net has nothing comparable to the
 commercial databases -- yet. It's not yet
 secure enough right now for such sensitive
 (and, more importantly, expensive)
 information. Some P.I.s say it's just a 
 matter of time, though, until the security
 can be assured enough that data companies
 like CDB/Infotek and TRW can offer their
 wares on the world's largest network. 	
    "I don't think the era has come into its
 own," says LaMont Bankson, an Arizona private
 eye who oversees a home page for investi-
 gators. The P.I.s he knows mostly use the
 Internet for making contacts with others
 around the country. "You have a budget of X
 amount of dollars and you need something in 
 Arizona and you can't fly out here. So you
 find a PI who can go down to the courthouse
 and check a record." 
    But the new era is fast approaching, says
 Dan Draz, a San Diego investigator who battled
 insurance and calling card fraud for Equifax
 and MCI before striking out on his own five
 years ago. He says he and Seanor represent a
 new breed: computer-literate thirty-somethings
 who have made investigating their chosen career,
 not just a way to earn some dough after retiring
 from the police force. P.I.s of the future, Draz
 predicts, will fall in two categories -- some
 will learn the 'net and the rest will trail
 behind. "There's a lot of guys out there who
 don't have computers in their office. I don't
 know how they'll compete."
    The prospect of gigabyte gumshoes beefing up
 their online arsenals thrills people like Draz,
 but leaves others nervous. 
    After all, probably the most famous
 computer-assisted investigation to date is the
 one that helped an Arizona man, Robert John
 Bardo, track down sitcom actress Rebecca
 Schaeffer in July 1989. Bardo, an obsessed fan
 of the My Sister Sam co-star, hired a PI to
 find Schaeffer's address. Then he skulked
 outside her West Hollywood apartment and killed
 her with a gunshot to her chest.
    The murder shocked Californians, many of
 whom had no idea that their personal data was
 available to any loon who cared to look for it,
 and prompted the state to clamp down on the
 release of information from motorists' records.
 Investigators can still get addresses, but only
 for the purpose of serving subpoenas, and
 they're subject to audits to assure they follow
 the rules. The Schaeffer killing also helped
 inspire a 1994 federal law that will force
 states to adopt restrictions next year on the
 type of data they release about motorists.  
    Privacy advocates believe that such efforts
 may be a good start but don't go far enough.
 "These problems are going to get worse and it's
 not going to just be name and address," says
 Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic
 Privacy Information Center. "It's going to be
 psychiatric records, high school grades.
 Whatever people want to know about you, they
 can find out." 
    But don't blame us, the P.I.s say. They say
 that if the fallout in California from the
 Schaeffer killing is any guide, the public
 will be hurt more than helped if information
 ever goes private.
	"I guarantee you that there are poor
 mothers that aren't getting their child
 support money because they can't find their
 deadbeat husbands," Mauzy says. He blamed
 the privacy craze largely on scary "look how
 much we can find out about YOU" stories
 concocted by journalists. 
    And, as he points out, many public records
 are a key part of the web of human relation-
 ships that keeps society functioning. If you
 own a house, your name and address, the
 property's value and the price you paid are
 a public record; that helps guard against
 fraud and ensure tax fairness. Companies like
 TRW and Equifax give consumers instant access
 to credit while giving businesses some
 assurance they won't get ripped off. If
 you're a roving con man, why shouldn't
 someone be able to find out? 
    In fact, Mauzy calls for opening even more
 records, such as criminal histories,  now
 available only in certain states, such as
 Florida. Why should states make records more
 available?  Think about hiring a nanny. As a
 parent, wouldn't you want to know if she had
 ever done anything  criminally naughty?
 "There's a point we're approach  ing, and I
 think we've passed it, where the government
 is helping people hide." Mauzy says.
    The same goes for Anthony Zinkus, who
 owns the Tucson agency that Bardo hired to
 track down Rebecca Schaeffer (although news
 accounts said a California investigator
 actually pulled her address). He's still
 using databases for routine missing-person
 and long-lost-love cases, like the one that
 netted Schaeffer. "It's rare that it's not
 for a legitimate or lawful purpose," Zinkus
 says. 
    He even questions proposals to close
 medical records. "You meet a nice chick
 tonight. Wouldn't you want to know if she
 has AIDS?" 
    Rotenberg disagrees: "Not everyone's a
 criminal. We should not treat them as if
 they were." Anyone who believes that most
 people don't care should compare a prison
 with a wealthy neighborhood: The inmates
 have no privacy at all, while the affluent
 use gates and walls to separate themselves
 from the riff-raff. "People who can afford
 it get as much privacy as they can."


VIRTUAL VOYEURISM 

    In a sense, P.I.s lie at the fault line
 of a very modern debate. The right to
 privacy -- a concept not found in the U.S.
 Constitution -- only entered the American
 legal lexicon a century ago. Well, 106
 years, to be exact, dating back to when
 future Supreme Court justice Louis
 Brandeis co-wrote his landmark Harvard Law
 Review article on the topic. That was
 during the dawn of yellow journalism, when
 new mass-market newspapers were
 titillating the populace with scandalous
 news culled from the courts and cop beat.
 The headlines caused many people to
 suddenly fear how much of their private
 lives was open to public scrutiny. 
    Modern society, more crowded, mobile
 and anonymous than the rural communities
 of old, creates the market for snoops.
 "Years ago, if you lived in Tombstone,
 there was somebody who knew everything
 about everybody anyway," Mauzy says.
 Today, "we have situations where somebody
 swoops into town from Maine and wants to
 invest in this or that. You have people
 that are popping up from foreign
 countries all the time now." 
    It's no coincidence that the same age
 has seen the rise of the private eye as an
 enduring figure in movies, TV shows and
 books. People like their privacy, but
 they're also voracious voyeurs. They scarf 
 up the National Enquirer and People and A
 Current Affair and Melrose Place and dial
 up "listen in on private conversation"
 900 lines to gain the illusion of peeping
 through the mini-blinds. So why should it
 be any different online? The hackers,
 after all, say information wants to be
 free. 
    Hackers have a lot in common with
 P.I.s. While most investigators have much
 to learn about cruising the 'net, most
 P.I.s are well versed in the art of
 "social engineering," the term used by
 hackers and phreaks for coaxing
 information out of unwitting humans.
 P.I.s call it using a "pretext." For 
 instance, claiming to be a creditor so a
 clerk will tell you somebody's bank
 balance is not uncommon.
    Such person-to-person dealings still
 make up the bulk of most private eyes'
 jobs. But as more people carry out their
 work, play and romances online, invest-
 igators are bound to follow them there. 
 It's a lot easier than most people
 realize, says Seanor, who often capital- 
 izes on other peoples' ignorance of the
 electronic trail they inadvertently leave
 behind when they shut off their computers. 
    Sometimes, it's manifested by
 corporate employees blabbing away on a
 newsgroup about some sensitive company
 project, apparently oblivious to the
 notion that the world is watching. "It's
 kind of weird," Seanor says, though
 occasionally not so weird. Sometimes the
 loose lips open up to some innocent-
 seeming query, like "Anybody know about
 plans for the latest minivan from Ford?" 
 The folks who answer never notice that
 the one posing the questions works for
 GM. 
    They also never notice that a simple
 search engine or archive, DejaNews, for
 example, can tell a nosy PI about most
 Usenet postings they've made in the past
 few months. (Seanor uses a similar
 search engine that he wrote himself.)
    Many users also assume that their
 e-mail is gone once they delete it. Bad
 mistake, as Ollie North learned during
 from Iran-Contra. In fact, many Internet
 providers keep all their users' mail
 backed up on tape for as long as six
 months. All it takes is a court order
 or a willing system administrator to
 open it up. Seanor's gone both routes in
 his hunt for illicitly traded data. 
	The same kind of help opens up
 a wealth of other info on a person's
 habits: When has the person been logged
 on? Do those times coincide with the
 times that someone was exporting stolen
 corporate secrets? Web sites' logs and new
 software being marketed to employers and
 schools can tell you what pages someone
 has been browsing.  On UNIX systems,
 users' .newsrc files will tell you if
 they've been avid readers of
 alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.bestiality
 or even alt.fan.barry-manilow.  
    If such things can be done legally,
 you can bet someone's doing them
 illegally too. It's not hard to guess that
 system administrators somewhere are
 getting off reading e-mail or taking
 bribes to pry sensitive data from people's
 accounts. 
    After all, in real life, privacy laws
 haven't stopped the emergence of a shadowy
 data underground, hawked by companies
 selling information stolen by corrupt cops
 or government workers. One 1991 federal
 probe netted Social Security employees, a 
 Chicago cop and a Georgia sheriff's clerk
 who, prosecutors said, sold confidential
 data to underground information brokers.
 The loot included people's salaries and
 work histories and data from the Federal
 Bureau of Investigation National Crime
 Information Center. 
    Even in California, in the grip of the
 state's supposed Iron Curtain-like
 information blackout, it only took Mauzy
 one day and $300 to get somebody's criminal
 history. He later found out that the local
 PI he hired used half the money to bribe a
 cop to get the data so quickly. "I was
 rather shocked to discover that I was part
 of it," says Mauzy, a former investigator
 for the Arizona attorney general's office.
 "I did not leave law enforcement to become
 a crook." 
	Is the same thing happening on the
 'net? You bet. For much the same reason
 that we will always have private eyes. As
 long as someone's trying to hide something, 
 someone else will try to pry it loose. 
    In a way, the locked door creates the
 possibility of the eye at the keyhole.
 If we never wore clothes, nobody would
 go to strip bars. Zinkus offers
 consolation, of sorts: You might be too
 insignificant to be worth spying on. 
    "It's people thinking that 'Hey, my
 little life is so important that everyone
 is trying to find out about me,'" he says.
 "When you get old you'll realize how few
 people really care."
