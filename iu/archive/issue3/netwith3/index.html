SPACE GHOST

Just because superheroes get to wear tights and shrug off bullets doesn't mean it's an easy gig. The 
unemployment line for cartoon heroes stretches longer than Plastic Man, and it's seldom pretty -- after a few 
years of pounding villains, cartoon stars are often replaced by newer good guys fighting tougher foes. 
Before you can say "Wonder Twin powers activate," Zan and Jana are flipping burgers and Gleek is 
working for spare change with an organ grinder down on 42nd Street.
<P>
  Space Ghost has changed all that. A multimedia powerhouse, the former intergalactic beefcake has not 
only weathered his post-saving-the-Universe phase, he's thrived in it. Space Ghost Coast to Coast, his talk 
show airing on the Cartoon Network, has become a cult phenomenon, with a motley slate of guests ranging 
from TV's Gilligan, Bob Denver, to R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe to exercise guru Susan Powter. Now, with the 
opening of Ghost Planet at <A HREF="http://www.ghostplanet.com">http://www.ghostplanet.com</A>, Space Ghost stands poised to expand his empire 
even further. IU caught up with Space Ghost at the Locust Club, Ghost Planet's late-night hot spot, to 
discuss his recent foray into cyberspace, the love life of a cartoon character and the I.Q. of Thundarr the 
Barbarian.

<FONT COLOR=00FF00><B>Internet Underground:</B></FONT> When did you first start surfing the 'net?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=FF00FF><B>Space Ghost:</B></FONT>  I guess I've been skiing the 'net since, oh, about 10:30 a.m. this morning. What's that? Right. 
Surfing the 'net. Whatever. Truth is, I'm relatively new to the Internet scene. Moltar is always pushing me 
to get with the program. I mean, the first time I heard "World Wide Web," I thought the Black Widow had 
ensnared your planet in some diabolical scheme. (IU note: the Black Widow is a villain from Space Ghost's 
original series, The Space Ghost and Dino Boy.)
<P>
<FONT COLOR=00FF00><B>IU:</B></FONT> Where do you hang out on Ghost Planet? What parts of Ghost Planet didn't make it into the Web site?
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=137 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="ghostie.gif" HSPACE=7 VSPACE=7>
<FONT COLOR=FF00FF><B>SG:</B></FONT> My favorite spot is probably the Studio, located just inside of Ghost Planet Industries. The idea of 
having a conversation with myself is irresistible to me. I could spend days and days in there.
But I have yet to see the Ghost Planet Commissary and Video Arcade in the Web site. They make the 
blackest coffee in the universe and always have the latest video games, like Earth Invaders.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=00FF00><B>IU:</B></FONT> How does Space Ghost Coast to Coast benefit or suffer from being on the Web?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=FF00FF><B>SG:</B></FONT> I don't think the show can suffer from being on the Web, unless we lose viewers to Moltar's lake of 
fire. And it's a great benefit, really, because people really need to see where you've been in order to know 
where you're going. I think I heard that on Oprah.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=00FF00><B>IU:</B></FONT> What do you say to your critics who accuse you of being a beefy post-adolescent living out a 
testosterone-filled fantasy?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=FF00FF><B>SG:</B></FONT> Ghost Planet to Earth: I'm a cartoon. Hell-o!
<P>
<FONT COLOR=00FF00><B>IU:</B></FONT> How did you enslave Zorak, your former archenemy, into serving as your bandleader? Is he getting paid 
overtime for being the Ghost Planet receptionist?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=FF00FF><B>SG:</B></FONT> Fortunately, Zorak was still enslaved where I had left him at the time my original series was canceled, 
in Omegan Prison. I like to think of Space Ghost Coast to Coast as my own little work-release program. 
Two years ago, Zorak was peeling space potatoes in Omegan Prison. Now he's peeling open envelopes 
filled with gushing fan mail! As for the receptionist, that's actually Zorak's second cousin, Stephanie. 
Uncanny resemblance, isn't it?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=00FF00><B>IU:</B></FONT> How do you avoid the leagues of starry-eyed fans who scour Ghost Planet for any contact with you?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=FF00FF><B>SG:</B></FONT> Easy. Inviso-Power! It comes in handy for so many things. Free movies. Concerts. Avoiding that 
second date.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=00FF00><B>IU:</B></FONT> How much do you get paid? What do you think of Letterman's huge contract with CBS?
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=144 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="spacy.gif" HSPACE=7 VSPACE=7>
<FONT COLOR=FF00FF><B>SG:</B></FONT> Like all cartoons, I am paid in a currency known as the Smackeroo. All I can tell you is that they count 
them out individually, "One smackeroo... two smackeroos..." and it takes a very long time. Letterman's 
contract, from what I understand, is short on Smackeroos.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=00FF00><B>IU:</B></FONT> Are you seeing anyone right now?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=FF00FF><B>SG:</B></FONT> No, I'm not. I am, however, writing a book that sums up my views on dating, Men Are From Mars, 
Women Are From Venus, So What Am I Doing in Albuquerque?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=00FF00><B>IU:</B></FONT> What do you feel is the future of technology?
<P>

<FONT COLOR=FF00FF><B>SG:</B></FONT> Judging from my limited experience on the World Wide Web, I'd have to say the ability to download 
3-D images of Pamela Lee from Baywatch.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=00FF00><B>IU:</B></FONT> Whatever happened to your erstwhile sidekicks Jan and Jace?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=FF00FF><B>SG:</B></FONT> Jan and Jace? Let's just say they got a copy of the home game. I did not invite them back to partake of 
my current show. Last I heard, they were deeply into Scientology.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=00FF00><B>IU:</B></FONT> How does cyberspace compare to outer space?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=FF00FF><B>SG:</B></FONT> Well, you can't download the lyrics to "Dancing Queen" in outer space.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=00FF00><B>IU:</B></FONT> What about the Web do you consider evil?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=FF00FF><B>SG:</B></FONT> The thought that Stephanie Miller has her own Web page.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=00FF00><B>IU:</B></FONT> Last, but not least, a question I have a wager on: Who would win a fight between you and Thundarr the 
Barbarian, and why?
<P>
<FONT COLOR=FF00FF><B>SG:</B></FONT> Yours truly, Citizen Ware. Here's a hint. 
In the superhero world, Thundarr's nickname is "Genius." Ask him to think an abstract thought like "What 
is the sound of one hand clapping?" He'll be tied up for hours, and you don't even have to lift a finger. You 
heard it here first.
