<B>To remail using the Cypherpunk remailers:</B><BR>
you need to attach a header, or a series of headers, to your mail message which will direct its path 
through the maze of machines.
<P> 
	The simplest way to tell your e-mail program what to do is to place two colons (::) next to each 
other on the very first line of the message. On the next line, type, Request-Remailing-To: and the 
address of the remailer. Skip one line. Then begin your normal message.[
<P> 
An example of chain remailing, the most secure form:

    From: IU@mcs.net
    To: remailer@rebma.mn.org

    ::<BR>
    Request-Remailing-To: remail@xs4all.nl

    ::
    Request-Remailing-To: recipient@destination.com

    Here is the text of my top-secret message.

	You can use only one remailer, but it is not very secure, because the remailing machine contains 
both the sender and the destination. Chaining (sending to two or more remailers) is the preferred 
method, because your return address is completely divorced from the destination.
<P>
	You must also be very careful to use the correct spelling and capitalization, as UNIX machines are 
case-sensitive and will not respond to instructions that they perceive to be spelled incorrectly.
