<B>By day, Soren Ragsdale, 20, 
is a mild-mannered computer science student</B> at the University of Arizona. But by night, the self-deputized Spam 
hunter girds his virtual pistol holster and patrols the Web in search of villainous abusers of the Internet, particularly, 
"spammers."  
<P>
   Exactly what is a spam? Hormel Foods jokes aside, a spam is a mass e-mailed or Usenet posted message usually 
mongering some kind of product or service. For instance, if you've ever received an unsolicited e-mail selling dubious 
legal services, long-distance calling plans, insipid T-shirts or atomic bomb blueprints of Fat Man & Little Boy, you've 
been spammed.  
<P> 
Most 'net users view spamming as a reprehensible marketing technique that clogs the life-giving arteries of the 
network. But despite the potential dangers this process poses to the Internet, spam outlaws continue their dirty deeds. 
Unfortunately, while federal law prohibits transmission of unsolicited faxes, no such rules exist for abusive spamming of 
the 'net. That's why Ragsdale, author of the "Who (or what) is Spam King" page <A HREF="http://com.primenet.com/spamking"><B>http://com.primenet.com/spamking</B></A> 
began his hunt a year ago.
<P>
His primary target?The infamous spammer Jeff Slaton, better known as Spam King. "The reason why I took on Jeff 
Slaton in particular was because when I would receive mail from him or see posts from him on a newsgroup, he wasn't 
even saying Îthis is a good idea.' He took it as Îna na na na, you can't catch me,'" says Ragsdale. "This was somebody just 
so obnoxious that I felt like I had to do something."

<P>
<IMG WIDTH=133 HEIGHT=167 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/soren.gif" VSPACE=15 VSPACE=15>

<B>To unnerve Slaton,</B> Ragsdale ferreted out information exposing the Spam King and posted a list at his site that 
includes Slaton's home phone number, home address, social security number, attorney's name and make of car with 
payments due. This tactic has worked insofar that Slaton has had to continually change his home phone number and e-
mail address to avoid the deluge of messages from irate Internet users. But according to Slaton, Ragsdale's page is more 
of an endorsement than an epitaph for the Spam King. 
<P>
"It really has worked in reverse because most people in the academic world, like Soren, haven't the slightest idea of 
marketing and they absolutely have no idea of the positive repercussions of his Web site in terms of economic 
renumerations to me for my services," says Slaton. "I don't care if they continue to have their Web sites up there. It 
simply perpetuates the Spam King legend." 
<P>
 
Not all spammers are as brazen as Slaton, however, and some even come crawling before Spamhunters on their 
hands and knees, looking for forgiveness. For example, a spamming offender listed on Alex Boldt's Blacklist of Internet 
Advertisers at <A HREF="http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~cbrown/BL/"><B>http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~cbrown/BL/</B></A> posted in regret, "Am currently blacklisted from rec.games.
video.arcade.collecting for advertising... Realize that it was inappropriate [sic] and have learned my lesson. Have served 
my time and am [sic] no longer a menace to society. Would like to be considered for parole. Will not jump bail."
<P>
As a general rule, Boldt, in the role of judge, jury and executioner, sentences spamming offenders to a minimum of 
three months time on the blacklist. Only after doing some hard time can ex-spammers hope to apply for a probation 
and have their name removed from the virtual Sing Sing -- although  the site's archive will always keep past offenders 
and their netiquette "crimes" posted for educational purposes. Understandably, spammers are none too pleased with 
Boldt's tactical warfare techniques, and from time to time, he receives some rather angry responses from direct 
marketers who have been given a good ol' Spamhunter branding. In spite of threats to sue or do bodily harm to him, 
Boldt remains stoically cool. "The flames I get after having put   someone on the list are rather predictable... Once they 
figure out that I'm German, the Nazi/Hitler analogy becomes very popular... If you have seen five, you've seen them 
all." But even those not involved in spamming are unhappy with Boldt's blacklist and accuse him of using tactics that 
are unfair and in direct opposition to the spirit of the 'net. Boldt makes the claim however, that his approach to 
spamming is completely in accord with the elan vital of the Internet and argues, "Punishing of unwelcome behavior 
should be done by private individuals, following the same grass roots philosophy that governs the rest of the 'net." 
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=208 HEIGHT=168 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="art/findspam.gif" VSPACE=15 VSPACE=15>
In keeping with that philosophy, Boldt, on his site, describes a number of guerilla tactics that have been proven to 
work against the more soft-minded of spam artists. Some retributive measures he recommends: <B>1)</B> Send e-mails to 
spammers who use automatic mail-back robots. Place their own address (or better yet, the address of another spammer 
who's also using an automatic mail-back robot), in the FROM or REPLY-TO header. This causes a furious mirror-in-
front-of-a-mirror response that effectively crushes the target's mail server. <B>2)</B> Waste a spammer's time by feigning 
interest or through use of an AI engine like "emacs doctor" that engages them in fake mail dialogue. <B>3)</B> For the truly 
emphatic, send the spammer a notice explaining that a charge of $500 will be incurred for the proofreading of every 
commercial spam you receive from them. The next time you're e-mailed by the spammer, send out an invoice. Unless 
they pay the fee, take them to small claims court. 
<P>
While Ragsdale recommends Boldt's reprisal tactics for impairing the actions of spammers, he also urges that 
service providers write a "damages provision" into subscription contracts so that abusive users are held pecuniarily liable 
for the costs of cleaning up their own piles of spam. Simply terminating the accounts of abusers is not enough anymore, 
says Ragsdale, because services like Inter-Ramp, a PSINet company, permits any spammer with a credit card to set up a 
free trial account and start all over again.
<P> 
In fact, it's through InterRamp that Ragsdale suspects Slaton has set up a number of new accounts from which he 
has been e-mailing forged spams -- each of which lists Ragsdale as the REPLY-TO. "I was coming back from going to 
a 7-11 to get a Thirstbuster. Luckily I was logged on at the time, and saw about 20 messages, mostly from Italian 
listservs saying, ÎThank you, your response has been posted,' or ÎI'm sorry, your response was not accepted,'" recalls 
Ragsdale. Realizing he had been framed, Ragsdale immediately set up a remailer to automatically respond to the flood 
of angry e-mails that would soon follow. 
<P>
There's no proof that Slaton actually sent the spam, but Ragsdale claims that the writing style is the same, "down to 
the bad grammar and misspelled words."  Additionally, the spam was traced back to a service provider that has a dial-in 
number located in Albuquerque, N.M. Currently, the University of Arizona legal department is investigating the 
matter.
<P>
"It's a silly accusation," laughs Slaton. "Albuquerque is kind of like a southwest Silicon Valley. We have a lot of 
people who use the Internet -- And there's a lot of activity that is done in my name on the Internet. It's disappointing to 
hear that, but not surprising." Although Slaton pleads "not guilty" to the accusation of spam forgery, Ragsdale remains 
suspicious and manifests that there's much more than a competitive rivalry at work here. In his estimation, Slaton is an 
unscrupulous businessman who'll do anything for a buck. 
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/mailbox.gif" VSPACE=15 VSPACE=15>
"He obviously doesn't care who he misleads so long as he gets paid," attests Ragsdale. "He even got a church to give 
him $450. And they listed their phone number, a toll-free number you can call --they got mail bombed; they got their 
account pulled. This is a church group that's doing charity work!" 
<P>
In defense of himself, Slaton insists that it was the president and founder of the church, Calvin Horn of Noon Day 
Ministries in Albuquerque, who in fact initiated the contact between the two parties. "He was intrigued by the idea of 
reaching millions of people on the Internet. And in spite of the fact that the articles [shown to him] were very 
controversial, to say the least, they sought out my services." Slaton also says that he suggested to members of the 
church's board that, prior to the spamming, they should set up some kind of answering machine service to field all calls.
<P> 
That's not the whole truth according to Pastor Dennis Lihte of Noon Day, who sat in on discussions between the 
church and Slaton. He admits that the ministry did indeed seek out Slaton's services, but he also says that the 
congregation wasn't sufficiently warned about the potential for damaging their organization's reputation, nor to the 
amount of contemptible feedback that would be received subsequent to the mass mailing.
<P>
Who's to blame? It's impossible to say, but one thing's for sure, spamming doesn't pay -- for the $450 spent on 
Slaton's service, the church collected no more than $20 before having to pull the plug. Even Slaton concedes that 
spamming is on the decline and says that he's hanging up the spurs and moving on to greener pastures. "The novelty 
has worn thin -- I've decided to let the little dogs fight over the small bits of scrap spam available."
<P>
As for Ragsdale and Boldt, they say they won't ease off anytime soon. Despite all the flames and beatings they're 
administered daily on related newsgroups, they both remain focused on their ultimate goal: No more spam.
