&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B> Driven by the</B> "laws of probability," or improbability as it were, <I>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</I> author, 
Douglas Noel Adams, 44, has moved from a job working as a bodyguard for an Arab royal family, to writing his 
own best-selling trilogy, to guest guitarist for rock legends 
Pink Floyd. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   What's next on the UK 
phenom's unusual itinerary? Fortunately for 'net users, Adams is presently  hard at work on an official 
<I>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</I> Web site about which he's rather closedmouthed, although he does expect it 
up and running by Winter '96. Also in development for Douglas in the year ahead is a television documentary 
series on evolution and another  chronicling the adventures of Dirk Gently and his holistic detective agency, and 
(possibly) the filming of a silver screen version of <I>Hitchhiker</I>, to which  <I>Ghostbusters</I> director and 
producer Ivan Reitman 
owns the rights. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   So without further ado, welcome the galaxy's most traveled hitchhiker as he joins IU to discuss his undying 
passion for Macs, his unrealized dream of rock stardom, and his work with the "multiple media" company, The 
Digital Village. And, of course, his impressions on the meaning of life, the universe and the Internet.

Internet</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=D88519> Underground</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=36003D>Currently, you're adapting some of your own work for the online world. What do you 
think of the Internet right now as an entertainment medium?</FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=CC0B0F>Douglas</FONT> <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=052D88>Noel</FONT> <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=2A8805>Adams</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=8F0011>I think the Web 
is something we haven't understood yet, and we're not using it properly. Whenever any new medium arrives, 
people bring old models with them. We're all familiar with how the film industry started, people just sort of 
put on stage plays and stuck a camera in front of it. I feel that in the last 10 years, we've all been encouraged to 
get wildly excited about desktop publishing. I think it should be a medium through which you are able to get 
much more information assembled on the fly.<BR> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I think that just wandering through endless brushes after a while gets to be a little less rewarding. Which is 
not being negative about the Web, but I think it's just saying that we haven't got it right yet. When telephones 
first started in this country, it was assumed that what we'd use them for was listening to concerts from the 
Albert Hall. And when that didn't work out too well, everyone said, ÎOh well, that's it for the telephone.'</FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=8703D3>I</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=D88519>U</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=36003D>And clearly multimedia entertainment has taken off. When did you become involved with multimedia?</FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=CC0B0F>D</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=052D88>N</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=2A8805>A</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=8F0011>It's funny, the most fun I've ever had in my professional career was actually doing the radio series of 
Hitchhiker many, many years ago. At that point we were a little team of people producing it. We were 
inventing all kinds of new production techniques as we went along. Radio hadn't been made that way before. I 
really, really enjoyed that. I enjoyed going into television rather less. Then I had fun putting on a stage 
production and a novel based on it. Then the novel kind of hijacked my burgeoning multimedia career at that 
point because it was such a success that it meant that the next thing I had to do quite clearly was write another 
novel. And so it went. So really I've been sort of a frustrated multimedia author struggling to get out. </FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=8703D3>I</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=D88519>U</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=36003D>You're co-founder of a new multimedia company titled The Digital Village (TDV) that's primarily involved 
with more computer/new technology-based entertainment. How and why did this corporation come together?</FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=CC0B0F>D</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=052D88>N</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=2A8805>A</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=8F0011>The prime founder is a great friend of mine named Robbie Stamp whose background is as a television 
documentary producer who, unlike virtually 
anybody I've ever met, has actually had a yen to be a manager. Most people dread management; he's very 
excited by management. But essentially, he's assembled a terrific team, including people from the world of 
publishing, television and online. So we kind of cover all the bases. We call ourselves very specifically, and note 
the additional syllable, a Îmultiple media' company. That's because multimedia is just one media. Most people 
in multimedia come from, largely speaking, (the)technology field. They form companies and don't necessarily 
have any background in print or text or television or whatever. It's funny because the television companies and 
the publishing companies all are saying, ÎOh we've got to get into CD-ROMs. Let's hire in someone who 
knows something about CD-ROMs and hope that they solve that problem for us.' But life isn't like that. So the 
way we're set up is to coverall of these bases, television, online, CD-ROM and so on. </FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=8703D3>I</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=D88519>U</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=36003D>I've heard you're also 
constructing a Web site? 
Is it up yet? </FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=CC0B0F>D</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=052D88>N</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=2A8805>A</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=8F0011>No, it's not up yet. One of the things we had to resolve for ourselves early on is do we go for a small 
Web site early, or do we hit the ground running with something quite well developed? We decided to take that 
latter route. So I can't say at the moment when it will be up, but we hope it will be something that will be 
pretty
strong by the time it goes up. 
I hope it will be this year.</FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=8703D3>I</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=D88519>U</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=36003D>What kind of content will be on the site?</FONT>
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=70 HEIGHT=74 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="art/tounge.gif" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=CC0B0F>D</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=052D88>N</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=2A8805>A</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=8F0011>I don't want to give away too much at the moment, but I would say that any successful Web site is going 
to combine two things. One is strong individual content of its own and the other is good navigational links and 
directory services to the rest of the Web.  Anybody who can help solve the problem of how you find the good 
stuff and how you find interesting stuff, stuff that is useful and particular to you will certainly be a great boon 
to the world. You may be surprised and astonished to hear that we will be calling our directory service The 
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Internet. [laughs] I know other people have appropriated that name but they're going 
to have to give it back now.</FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=8703D3>I</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=D88519>U</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=36003D>I'm sure you'll publish some of your own work on 
the Web site.</FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=CC0B0F>D</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=052D88>N</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=2A8805>A</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=8F0011>Oh, very much so. At this point I don't want to say that it will specifically have this or that. But my 
inclination is, if in doubt, put it up.</FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=8703D3>I</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=D88519>U</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=36003D>What other multiple media projects are you currently involved with?</FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=CC0B0F>D</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=052D88>N</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=2A8805>A</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=8F0011>There's a thing I'm working on right at the moment. It will be an original work of fiction that will 
actually originate as a CD-ROM. And that's kind of a pointed principle for me. Anybody can take a book and 
turn it into a CD-ROM. But, of course, a book is linear, and you'll produce rather linear CD-ROMs as a 
consequence. The CD-ROM that we're in the early stages of developing will be something that draws its first 
breath as a CD-ROM.</FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=8703D3>I</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=D88519>U</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=36003D>Any other projects Adams fans can look forward to?</FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=CC0B0F>D</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=052D88>N</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=2A8805>A</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=8F0011>Yes, there's a book that I'm terribly, terribly late on at the moment and everybody's getting fed up, 
including me. And to be honest, it has gone on to the backburner because of all of the Digital Village projects. 
It'll move forward to the front burner, but it's a book that, so far, has gone through too many versions and I 
was just sort of losing sight of what I was doing. It may well be that that one even stays on the backburner and 
that I'll just sit down and simply write a completely different book because you can work on the same thing for 
too long.</FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=8703D3>I</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=D88519>U</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=36003D>At the alt.fan.douglas-adams FAQ, it's said that you often look for ways to procrastinate when working on 
new projects. Do you spend much time on the Web, looking for ways to waste time?</FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=CC0B0F>D</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=052D88>N</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=2A8805>A</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=8F0011>I try not to do much aimless surfing around on the Web, but I use it a lot. If you're as busy as we are at 
the moment in setting up a company, then there's an awful lot of information just about other companies out 
there that might have useful resources or useful partnerships, or software.</FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=8703D3>I</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=D88519>U</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=36003D>Speaking of partnerships, word has it that you're developing products for Apple first and Windows second. 
In light of the difficulties and your apparent taste for Macintoshes, has anything changed with your 
development plans, and would you please consider taking over the company yourself?</FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=CC0B0F>D</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=052D88>N</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=2A8805>A</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=8F0011>[laughs] No, I don't think so. I'm watching with interest. For people who love Macintoshes, it has been 
a very frustrating time. But we've announced our technology partnership with Apple and people sort of said, 
ÎWhy with Apple, they're in trouble?' Well, yeah maybe they are in trouble. But first of all, I have every 
expectation that they will survive this particular twisty-turn as they have survived earlier twisty-turns. But also, 
we are a development company and we want to develop using the best technology, and Apple is clearly the 
best technology. The world needs Apple. </FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=8703D3>I</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=D88519>U</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=36003D>You say Îthe world needs Apple,' but clearly the Internet is very America-centric. Does this bother you, and 
are Americans as rude on the Internet as they are in person?</FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=CC0B0F>D</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=052D88>N</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=2A8805>A</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=8F0011>At the moment, obviously, most of the people on the Web are American. But I very much hope that if 
the whole world comes online that cultural diversity will actually thrive because everything will be equally 
present. I hope that doesn't turn out to be a false hope, but I think there's every reason to be optimistic and 
certainly proactive in encouraging cultural diversity.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=8703D3>I</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=D88519>U</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=36003D>By the way, in regard to the alt.fan.douglas-adams FAQ I just mentioned, do you read it or any other 
Douglas Adams newsgroups on the 'net?</FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=CC0B0F>D</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=052D88>N</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=2A8805>A</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=8F0011>When I first discovered them I used to sort of read it quite a lot, but I haven't so much as of late. I'll tell 
you why. I think once we set up our Web site here it will become more of an issue, but the thing was that I 
would read something and reply to give somebody
some information, answer a question or whatever. Then, in an incredibly short time that information would 
become so garbled -- you'd see people passing it around to each other. So I would then have to intervene and 
say Îno, no, no, that isn't what I said, it's this other thing.' Because there is no persistency on the newsgroups, 
you just get chinese whispers happening at an extraordinary rate. So what I'll do when we have our Web site 
set up, is kind of interact with the newsgroups a little bit. I'll answer stuff on the Web site so that it stays there, 
the correct information. </FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=8703D3>I</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=D88519>U</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=36003D>You must receive an enormous amount of e-mail from fans. Do you respond to all of the letters sent to 
you?</FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=CC0B0F>D</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=052D88>N</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=2A8805>A</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=8F0011>I try to reply but I have to admit that I don't reply to everything. Sometimes you get a lot of kooky 
letters from people, and you look through for some particular question they're asking that you can answer 
simply. And there isn't one, so I say, Îoh well,' and move on to the next. </FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=8703D3>I</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=D88519>U</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=36003D>Are you surprised by the number of sites devoted to you on the Internet?</FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=CC0B0F>D</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=052D88>N</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=2A8805>A</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=8F0011>I guess there's sort of a strong crossover between people who might enjoy my books, and people who 
use the Web. I don't know what that says about any of us, but there certainly does seem to be a strong 
crossover.</FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=8703D3>I</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=D88519>U</FONT>:  <FONT COLOR=36003D>Before I let you go, I'm just curious, what does Douglas Adams do when he's not writing or not surfing 
the Internet?</FONT>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=CC0B0F>D</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=052D88>N</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=2A8805>A</FONT>: <FONT COLOR=8F0011>Play the guitar. I play with my daughter. One of my still to be realized ambitions is that I do want to be 
a rock star, and I feel that I'm now nearly old enough.</FONT>
