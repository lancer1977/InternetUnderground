&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet is complex, expansive and confusing.  Sure, it has provided all of us here at <I>IU</I> with steady-paying jobs, but it also frustrates us to maddening ends. So, as sort of a cathartic exercise, our psychoanalysts suggested that we take out our aggressions on this mass of technology by belittling it in some way. "Break down the Internet into more manageable components," they proposed. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By the end of our session, our team of analysts came up with a treatment: they suggested that we develop a story of top tens cataloguing things about the Internet that we find both irksome and enjoyable. Of course, we immediately demanded our money back. "Bunch of shrinks," we scoffed,  top 10s have been done to death. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, late one night, while waiting for the most recent beta version of Netscape to download, our edgy <I>IU</I> staff gathered for a little R&R and watched a film favorite, <I>This Is Spinal Tap</I>. We just love that scene in which Nigel Tufnel (played by Christopher Guest), shows off his amplifier board. All of the dials, as Tufnel notes, go up to 11.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then it just clicked. We could do the top 10 lists after all, but also make them new and original by having our lists go up to 11. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, dear reader, it worked. Our staff's collective nervousness has passed and our interest in the Internet has been revitalized.  So here they are, our <B>Top 11 Lists</B>.

Top 11 Notable Things Ever Said About the Internet

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wanted to share quotes we thought were astute, however, that would be too genteel; we couldn't resist the opportunity to also reveal the multitudes of ridiculous statements. When people don't know much about something, they have a tendency to say stupid things about it.  Congress has been doing it for years, so it's no wonder some of the more ludicrous statements can be attributed to one of its members.

You've probably never heard of <I>Phrack</I>. In a way, that's the point. <I>Phrack</I>, a truly underground publication, has succeeded despite its obscurity and narrow scope, offering tribute to the  dedication of the hacking mind.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Started in 1985, <I>Phrack</I> ranks up there as one the longest-running electronic publications. Its digital pages are devoted to phreaking and hacking, both manifestations of the art of exploring, playing with and infiltrating telephone and computer networks. The site mentions that During its lifetime <I>Phrack</I> has always been at the center of controversy. Since the magazine has always been openly available, it presented law enforcement officials with what they perceived to be a direct link into the secret society of computer hackers. Not truly understanding either the spirit of the magazine or the  community for which it was written, federal agents and prosecutors began to target <I>Phrack</I> magazine and those affiliated with it. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Law enforcement officials are  invited to read <I>Phrack</I> -- as long as they register and pay a fee. The editors,  however, encourage hobbyists to read the magazine <I>gratis</I>. Information should be free; that's the hacker creed.

<A HREF="http://www.dejanews.com"><B>http://www.dejanews.com</B></A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
DejaNews proves that words sometimes can come back to haunt you, thanks to its virtual vaults of old Usenet posts.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's right, all your flames, those angry rants and the stuff you wrote after a few too many beers at the terminal now sit side-by-side with your most lucid, persuasive arguments in the DejaNews archives. The creation of DejaNews alarmed many netizens, especially those who posted with the belief that their words were transient, never realizing those same words might one day be catalogued for posterity in a library searchable by name and topic.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Started in 1979 with a handful of groups, Usenet now includes more than 13,000 special interest boards for discussion on topics ranging from Unix to beer brewing to foreign policy. The language of Usenet has always had a special quality, familiar and intimate, yet still formal, even in the harshest of flames. In this time-suspended  public forum, users mistakenly believe that when their posts drop out of rotation (usually after a few weeks), they are gone forever. But it just isn't so anymore. DejaNews currently archives posts back to March 1995 for a total of 50 gigabytes of searchable data. Maintainers of the site say they plan to expand the service further, to include the last several years. DejaNews has essentially transformed Usenet from a transitory corkboard into a permanent library. The possibilities are astounding; you can compile a small report on a particular topic or track an individual's postings over time. This could be used for good, perhaps to conduct research on a particular topic. It also could allow someone to use your words against you, years from now.

&nbsp;9. &nbsp;<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=C00000><B>HotWired</B></FONT><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.hotwired.com"><B>http://www.hotwired.com</B></A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most commercial Web sites can trace their inspiration back to HotWired, the digital cousin of Wired. Innovative  design coupled with a then-foreign  medium allowed HotWired to grab the mainstream's attention and, for many, to serve as a role model. HotWired showed budding Webmasters that people would visit sites over and over again, even though it  sported a design that sometimes exceeded its content. Even now, Webmasters continue to copy HotWired's basic layout. As one of the first sites to feature display advertising, HotWired also helped usher in the commercial era of the Web. But being first only goes so far. Since the inception of HotWired, many new sites have taken its basic format and improved upon it. Plenty offer better content, many offer superior graphics. So, by the time you read this, HotWired will likely have evolved again. Expected changes include collaboration with a beefed-up version of <I>Suck</I> (<A HREF="http://www.suck.com">http://www.suck.com</A>), the acerbic e-zine started independently by two trouble making HotWired employees that was later bought by their employer. In terms of content, <I>Suck</I> itself earns a distinguished place on this list. Carl Steadman and Joey Anuff deserve credit for being among the first to illustrate how to successfully write for the Web and by creatively weaving hyperlinks into their stories.

<BR> 

&nbsp;8. &nbsp;<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=C00000><B>Zima</B></FONT><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.zima.com/"><B>http://www.zima.com</B></A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This site could be credited with exposing advertisers to the possibilities of creating their own content on the Web, something that causes us to shudder. Featuring a fridge packed with information explaining how to get around the Internet as well as a sales pitch for the clear alcoholic beverage,  <A HREF="http://www.zima.com/">http://www.zima.com</A> was arguably the first high-profile consumer site. It was also the first product to feature an e-mail address and later, a URL on its label. "It was also the first episodic content anywhere on the Internet, let alone advertising," notes G.M. O'Connell, the founder of Modem Media, the agency that created the site. People who stopped by the Zima fridge could follow the antics of a marginally likeable character named Duncan through regularly written reports on his love life.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Duncan wasn't the only attraction. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here was a lot of value-added informational content that was important a year-and-a-half ago. It had pointers to useful places on the 'net, it had information about how to get around," O'Connell says. His company also took advantage of the earliest mass advertising arenas as well. When HotWired launched shortly after the Zima site debuted, the company bought loads of banners. At the time, banners were new. People still clicked on them. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zima made a splash thanks to timing. Being first meant that others would have to follow. What kind of patterns would they adopt? Those that worked. No one can argue that Zima's overall marketing strategy wasn't successful. Modem Media wanted to get people to the site and they went there in big numbers. In many ways, Zima helped solidify a paradigm; create a site, distribute banners in key places to build traffic and sustain the momentum by  advertising in more traditional mediums.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Web continues to expand, however, many of those basic elements have started to dissipate. At one point, HotWired reported that as many as 40 percent of the people who came across the Zima banners were clicking on them to get to the site. Now, most banners are lucky to get 5 percent of a site's traffic. "Since (zima.com) was launched, there's been a lot of imitations and emulsions. We've seen some growth (in how advertising is presented), but not much," O'Connell says.

&nbsp;7.  &nbsp;<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=C00000><B>The Spot</B></FONT><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.thespot.com/"><B>http://www.thespot.com</B></A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could Web surfers not be seduced by sun-lovin' Californians, especially if they're wired? <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's what the creators of this episodic Web serial figured when they started The Spot in June of 1995. Essentially, The Spot took the basic concept of Zima's fictional Duncan and developed it into a stand-alone daily program. American Cybercast Network hoped to create an interactive version of television soaps. For a while, it worked. Fans flocked to the site to read the online diaries and to e-mail characters in hope of a response. But the suds of this online soap started to fizzle after the novelty of taking part in a cyber  version of <I>Melrose Place</I> wore off. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kay Dangaard, senior vice president of American Cybercast Network, a branch of Fattal & Collins agency in Marina del Rey, Calif., isn't surprised that many followed the interactive format of The Spot. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Major entertainment and  communication companies were contending with the question of how to put original entertainment on the Internet. We decided to jump in,  boots and all, and do it. We launched The Spot, online, and we had an immediate hit. Now there's a proliferation of episodic Web sites that have followed."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of whether you ever thought Glenn Davis was cool, you have to admit that he started a phenomenon. While working as a bulletin board manager for the service provider InfiNet, Davis started a hobby of finding sites he liked and then showing them to his friends. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he started Cool Site of the Day in August 1994, the Web was still in a fledgling state. "There were people who told me that I wouldn't last a month," Davis says. At first he received only a handful of hits. By the end of last year, CSotD was   generating 40,000 hits daily and people were literally falling over themselves to have the former toll collector anoint their site with his golden hyperlink.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Davis has since left to start his own venture with the patently unoriginal name "Project Cool." But CSotD lives on and so does its impact;  legions of netizens now decree themselves arbiters, regardless of their yardstick. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Davis also revived a trend we find continually disturbing -- this whole "cool" business. Would someone please come up with another adjective? <P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Web, once a bastion of free information, increasingly resembles cable TV. Huh? Well, with cable you pay a monthly fee for basic content; premium channels such as HBO or Disney are extra. You might be able to blame ESPN SportZone if this whole cable model takes off. SportsZone offers a lot of information for free, but it charges a monthly subscription fee for full access to the site. While company officials won't say how many subscribers they've pulled in, they note that the site's success shows that people are willing to pay for good content. As companies realize that ads alone won't pay for their sites, expect more to follow ESPN's lead. <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, <I>Playboy</I> and <I>Autosite</I> have already moved to a two-tiered system.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
No one would ever make the mistake of calling the World Wide Web Consortium a flashy site. Yet inside the plain-paper wrapping of standard grey background and default text beats the heart of the Web. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W<SUB>3</SUB>C is an industry consortium run by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in collaboration with CERN, the   particle physics lab in Europe where the Web was born. Their mission: Set standards and develop software for the Web, and act as the scribes and personal attendants to the new technology.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is the W<SUB>3</SUB>C busy doing? Projects include working to define and simplify ratings systems, graphics specifications, electronic payment schemes, auditing and demographics, security and multimedia. They have led the way in creating new standards for HTML. They maintain a library of Web references that gives a history of the Web as well as primers on various Internet resources. They also serve up all kinds of free Internet software, from an http server to a robotic application that can traverse the Web to their own Web browser, Arena. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding for the project is provided by W3C members, and its dance card is packed with some prestigious names. You'll recognize such suitors as Apple, Microsoft, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Adobe, NEC, AOL, Digital, MCI, Sony, Netscape and scores more. Make it past their uninspiring page design and you'll find a quiet, priceless library.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Yawn</I>. Yep, we're profiling Yahoo. Yeah, we know. You've been there, done that. We understand that it makes you feel good to act all jaded, but don't you dare pretend you're too good to use Yahoo. C'mon. Everyone uses Yahoo and everyone should. We're here to tell you why. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, Yahoo is a paradox of trends.  As more people get online and visit Yahoo on their maiden voyage, it becomes decidedly uncool for veterans to go there. Ironically, Yahoo increases in usefulness every time a newbie links to it. Why? Yahoo is designed to grow and branch out from the collective consciousness. Unlike a traditional library, where the establishment decides where books fit in the Dewey Decimal System, Yahoo is a massive project, reflecting the unusual interests of Web users and demanding its own (often bizarre) categorical structure. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site was created by two Stanford University electrical engineering graduate students, David Filo and Jerry Yang. They began the library of sites in April 1994 as a glorified hotlist. It soon became popular, and in early 1995, Marc Andreessen of Netscape invited the pair to move the database over to Netscape's servers. As the then-default directory of the world's most popular browser, Yahoo developed a built-in audience that soon catapulted into name-brand status. It wasn't long before the task of indexing sites grew into a full-time job, and the two students decided to make a living from it, officially launching Yahoo, the company. With their recent public offering, they're now rich and famous and the envy of schmoes everywhere. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FAQ notes that "The name Yahoo! is supposed to stand for ÎYet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle' but Filo and Yang insist they selected the name because they considered themselves yahoos." We theorize that it denotes a yelp of glee, not unlike a Homer Simpson-style "Woohoo!" Karen Edwards, director of brand management for Yahoo comments, "The future of Yahoo is very dependent upon how cool or interesting the sites are that people create. If there continues to be a large  volume of increasingly creative sites, then our surfer team is going to be even busier indexing sites in an intuitive, human way. Our challenge will continue to be making sense of the growing mass of content and pointing people into the right places, not just as many places as possible."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there may not be such a thing as a <A HREF="http://www.underground-online.com/origin/freefood/">free lunch</A>, Netscape's site is the closest the 'net has to offer. Netscape's site went online in the fall of 1994 in the dark ages of the Web. Within six months, the Netscape browser became the standard bearer on the Web, a position the company still holds almost two years later. The reason for Netscape's popularity? Primarily, the price. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our browser was better, more flexible and freely available. The switching costs to Netscape were low -- it did all that Mosaic did, but better," says Martin Haeberli, Netscape's director of technology. Netscape has maintained its leading position through constant innovation. Version 2.0 incorporated tables, java applets, Shockwave and a host of plug-ins. The company's unique strategy can be felt throughout the Web where new programs (RealAudio, Shockwave) or ones that previously cost money (QuickTime), also are given away free for the download. Many 'net pundits question how long Netscape will be able to keep its position as lord of the Web, especially with Bill Gates threatening to take it over. Haeberli remains confident. "We set the pace and we will continue to set the pace," he says.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Electronic Frontier Foundation is kind of like Amnesty International or the American Civil Liberties Union. You don't pay much attention to them -- until you're jailed in some hellhole with a crust of bread and no water or some small-town official says you can't hold your feminist rally on public property.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in the wild new frontier of the Internet, you might not give the EFF a second thought -- until you realize that the government is proposing to hold the key to your encrypted communications, and on top of that, they don't want to hear any more dirty language. The EFF, however, has had a higher profile in recent months as it lobbied against the Communications Decency Act and launched the ensuing Blue Ribbon Campaign. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EFF, founded in 1990, serves the public good primarily through their newsletter and their Action Alerts that describe threats to online freedom and educate through publishing the case history, judicial rulings, press clippings and linking to relevant Web sites. Their concerns are preserving free speech and the right to cryptography and privacy.  The EFF was the first organization that realized that freedom of online speech would one day be subject to scrutiny and endangered a scary vision that proved to be true.
