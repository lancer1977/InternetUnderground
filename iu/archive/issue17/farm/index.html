<B>It all started</B> with a 
confused message on my machine: "He's got Bionic Man reel-to-reel 
tape units five feet tall with a SCSI-1 interface! Want to set your 
watch? There's a GPS clock over the TV satellite phone in the back, 
battlefield perimeter alarms, X-ray machines, phone switches, 
blargaahhh..." This message was just one of many that began pouring 
into DEF CON world domination headquarters not long ago, detailing 
a hidden outpost on the outskirts of Seattle. This outpost, known to 
some as Uncle Ira's Fun Farm O' Death (FOD), 
houses loads of cool technological gizmos and government surplus 
high-tech wizardry that would turn even the head of a Cult of the Dead 
Cow cyberninja strike force.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After learning about the Fun Farm O' Death, I quickly contacted 
some cohorts to obtain directions. The following is a composite of 
many return visits to FOD. What I found there was astounding.
<P>
<BR>

<B>THE SETTING</B>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Just <I>finding</I> the farm is a tough task. Getting there means a 
long ride through the peaceful farmland east of Bothell, Wash. Every 
time I drive there I'm amazed by the fact that this concealed Brigadoon 
of cool toys and technology exists; I can't help but laugh when I think 
of how difficult it must have been to transport things like the five 7-
foot cabinets of the System 85 phone switch so far from the 
nearest post office. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Picture an ordinary-looking farmhouse, perhaps slightly run-down, 
that's positioned next to a barn and another smaller building. There are 
several cars parked adjacent to the barn, as well as several large trucks 
that appear to be used for hauling "large things." Behind one of the 
buildings, there's an Inmarsat Sat Phone. On the porch of the house, 
there's a USSB satellite dish. Littering the backyard are numerous 
military-like transport crates, and in the pasture behind the barn there 
are two horses.

<B>UNCLE IRA: TECHNO-PIMP</B>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The proprietor of this strange place doesn't refer to it as the Fun 
Farm O' Death. Instead, it's called Meco, or Moser Electronics 
Company.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Uncle Ira, a true techno-pimp, owns the farm and has been 
collecting, repairing and selling data communications equipment since 
1980, when he was in high school. This interest continued through his 
college years, and now his sometime hobby has turned into a full-time 
job. The guy is impassioned about his work--his business card even has 
an RS-232 chart printed on the back--useful for when one needs to 
remember that pins four and five on the modem cable are Request to 
Send (RTS) and Clear to Send (CTS). Don't see the usefulness? Good.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At about six feet tall, with glasses, a clean-cut beard and a bit of a 
paunch, Uncle Ira can consume more info than Liz Taylor can food at a 
champagne buffet. Need to understand 16 frequency QSM? Need an 
answer on how to make your passive fiber FL hub active? Who starred 
in the movie <I>Colossus: The Forbin Project</I>? How much 
money did Boeing lose trying to sell the Saudis the Peace Shield system 
for air defense? Ask Ira. Even at 1 a.m., when I need to know what 
version of Solaris works with a Sun 410, I ring Uncle Ira for a turbo 
answer.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Apparently, Uncle Ira has customers the world over, techno-pimps 
similarly crazed about data communications gear and computing odds 
and ends. Just as the computer underground has its multitudinous 
factions of whacked zealots, so does the world of used electronic 
equipment buyers and sellers. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some of Uncle Ira's customers have rather specific fetishes. Uncle Ira 
describes one as a time freak; he just loves time and purchases every 
conceivable type of clock. When Uncle Ira gets his hands on a few 
atomic clocks (which use rubidium instead of cesium because it has a 
more stable time base), then bam!--they're shipped off to the time freak 
in, count 'em, milliseconds! Datum 9390 GPS time clocks? Pow! Off to 
the time freak! Airport X-ray machines? Zammo! Off to the terrorist--
er, the guy who likes to salvage the light intensifier tubes! Over the 
years, Uncle Ira has learned who will buy what and at what price. 
Often, he'll just sell or trade shiny, cool-looking goods to other used 
equipment dealers, as a sort of swap. Except in this instance, phone 
switches are being exchanged instead of baseball cards.
<P>
<BR>

<B>THE TECHNOPIMP  VS. THE MAN</B>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When it comes to acquiring cool technological commodities, there 
are several resources available to the buyer: the government, industry 
and private parties. Obviously, most of the really cool hi-tech gear 
comes from the government (referred to from here on out as the man). 
You must remember, the man is easily confused. Because the man's 
policies for getting rid of cool stuff are all screwed up, it's rather easy 
for world-domination-hungry computer network troublemakers to get 
their paws on said gear. There are two main agencies from which to 
purchase computer-related equipment: The Department of Defense's 
DRMS (Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service) and the GSA 
(General Services Administration). The DRMS offers the buyer mostly 
military surplus stuff, some of it over 30 years old. The GSA manages 
all other non-Department of Defense government agency property, 
primarily computers and related office equipment.

<FONT SIZE=2><TT>Dark Tangent with some goods</TT></FONT></TD>
</TR></TABLE>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The DRMS enforces hundreds of strange rules on what equipment 
must be destroyed and what can survive to see the light of another day. 
Unfortunately, computer and communications gear that was fine to sell 
two years ago has suddenly found itself tracked in databases, wrapped 
tightly in red tape and targeted for decommission (in other words, 
destroyed). The DRMS is decommissioning 25-year-old tube radios; 
the GSA, on the other hand, has no such regulation on old tube radios, 
and sells them to the public, a typical example of government 
contradiction. Confusing matters more about what can be bought and 
sold, private industry is bound by few prescripts, if any--Boeing, IBM 
and other large government contractors routinely rid themselves of 
Tempest-rated computers (heavily shielded equipment that prevents 
adversaries from remotely monitoring your screen) that the DRMS 
would otherwise destroy.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As a sidenote, the Department of Motor Vehicles has an even more 
ridiculous decommissioning process. Want to buy a "Humm-Vee" jeep 
to drive around town? Not a chance, thanks to current regulations that 
require Humm-Vees to be destroyed. It used to be that the outlawed 
vehicles merely had to be cut into two pieces to be decommissioned. 
But because people were welding them back together, new 
decommissioning laws now apply. Humm-Vees have to be: A) crushed 
and compacted, B) driven over by a tank or C) cut into four pieces, 
corner to corner, by a cutting tool that displaces no less than a half 
inch of material. Why, you ask? Because the Humm-Vee doesn't meet 
current federal safety standards: it doesn't have a padded dashboard or 
a "neutral" position on the gear box! To the half-wits at the DMV, it's 
better to spend more money crushing the vehicle with a tank than it 
would take to install some padding. And this is how the government 
operates with regard to cool computer gear.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So Uncle Ira has had to learn all of the how-tos on bidding and 
purchasing items he wants to adopt for the Fun Farm O' Death. 
Problem is, the various agencies and companies that use these auctions 
as trash disposals force buyers to purchase goods en masse. If you want 
that 386 PC with the 1 gig drive, you'll also have to buy the three 
pallets of printer sound hoods. The auctioneers seed one box of good 
stuff with 10 boxes of partially assembled wiring harnesses and pillows-
-just so that they can clear out their warehouses. Some universities sell 
off their equipment, but take the printed manuals and operating 
instructions and recycle them separately. A total nightmare for Uncle 
Ira.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Also, buying a computer with a hard drive means taking a gamble 
that it even still works. No money-back guarantees. Some large 
companies will de-gauss the hard drives in order to wipe them of data; 
this also makes the drives unusable. Some places just trash the 
workstation drives, but don't touch the servers. And sometimes 
auctioneers sell tape backups with data still on them.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the flip side, there are also times when the auctioneers' sloppiness 
works to Uncle Ira's advantage. He once scored a direct hit against the 
man when he purchased a large box of stuff that the DRMS failed to 
spot. They managed to crush a bunch of 30-year-old radios, but 
overlooked 
a perfectly good, one-year-old 
computer. Mission accomplished!
<P>
<BR>


<B>DISINTEGRATORS AND OTHER COOL DEVICES</B>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Once Uncle Ira has scored his load of shiny stuff at an auction, he 
loads it into "Mad Jesus," his pickup truck with a tail lift. And off he 
goes to FOD. There, the random gear is sold, in a few days, a few 
weeks, a few years. Some stuff Ira has yet to sell: techno-junk that been 
residing in his barn for years, gathering dust and targeted by owl shit. 
(As a frequent visitor to the farm, I've had the unfortunate occasion to 
witness Ira and his 12-gauge ridding the barn of trespassing owls.)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When Uncle Ira really can't move certain goods, he counts on "The 
China Man" to make a wholesale purchase of the junk. The 
China Man isn't really Chinese, 
but bears the nickname because the final destination of Uncle Ira's 
unsellable equipment is either China or Taiwan. There, a hive of 
workers dismantles the equipment into its component parts: bolts, 
screws, wires, and so on. Uncle Ira sells this junk by the pound--stuff 
like old frame racks and cabling guts from decommissioned medical 
systems--to make room for newer junk in his barn. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What new stuff? It's impossible, even for Ira, to detail all of the cool 
techno-gear he has stashed away at the farm. When I attempt to relate 
the story of Ira and his funky farm to my friends and acquaintances, 
they usually tune out somewhere between the part about the 20 KW 
battlefield power turbines that run on JP4 or diesel, and the 
disintegrators that can eat phone books and turn them into mere dust 
particles. FOD is a place that the human mind isn't capable of imaging 
with the aid of words alone. Seeing is believing. Even then, it's difficult 
to 
comprehend.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The first time I arrived at the farm, I nearly broke the bank. I wanted 
the datacryptor-64 DES boxes, the fiber transceivers, the rack-mount 
modems, the cool encrypted radios and the trunked 800 MHz police 
radio with computer interface. In short, I was in heaven. Everywhere I 
looked there was something that, with a little bit of elbow grease, 
could be made workable again. Fireproof filing cabinets! Zero 
aluminum briefcases! Even a military version of a System 85 phone 
switch with three hours of use! A geek's fantasy come true! Remember 
to breathe slowly.
<P>
<BR>

<B>HAGGLING WITH UNCLE IRA: NO EASY TASK</B>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You've located the shiny object that you want (whether it's that DEC 
server 5000 or the Microwave T1 kit). Now comes the fun part. Don't 
sweat it, though! Although Uncle Ira owns vast silicon acres of stuff, 
you're the one with cash in hand. And Ira wants to part you from it. 
You did bring cash, didn't you?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Step One: Check out the shiny object you desire only when Uncle Ira 
isn't looking. The less interested you seem in a purchase, the easier it is 
to haggle with Uncle Ira. This can be tricky, so be sure to bring enough 
accomplices with you to confuse and distract him. First, fire off the 
secret signal that tells your cohorts to point at something and say, 
"Whoa, is that a rack-mounted Apple Mac II with VME backplane, 48 
Volts DC power supply and 64 serial ports?!?" Uncle Ira will wander 
over and say something like, "This is an ill piece of equipment. It used 
to be an alarm controller for a telephone company. Blah, blah, blah÷"  
Now, get a good look at the item you want. Does it have all of its 
parts? What are the serial and part numbers? Is it covered in owl poo? 
Soon enough, Uncle Ira will be wondering what you're up to, so be 
nimble, Jack! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Step Two: Feign indifference. Get a price. Say something like, "Just 
checking out the [fill in the blank]. How much do you want for it?"  
TECHNO PIMP ALERT! Never forget for even a moment that Uncle 
Ira is the Techno Pimp! He'll always respond to a price query with 
something like, "Umm, well, it's got these trick connectors, and I sold 
one back in '95 for $xxx. So, like, maybe the cost is ($xxx - $yy) = 
$zzz?"  At this point you must refocus the conversation and respond, 
"OK, cool. What's this thing over here?" 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Step Three: Hit the Web when you get home, call the manufacturer, 
find out if the shiny object is still supported or if you can receive 
software or an old manual for it. If so, find out what other people are 
selling it for. The next time you are at the Farm O' Death, implement 
the final phase... 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Step Four: "I was thinking about [fill in the blank]. I saw one for 
cheaper/better condition/less owl poo. How about $zzz - $aaa? I've got 
cash." If you've played your cards right, Uncle Ira will counter with, 
"Ow, you break my arm! You break my arm! Cash is good." It's all 
about the art of the deal. Uncle Ira loves to bargain. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Price is related to how much Uncle Ira knows about something, and 
it's also directly correlated with what I like to call the "Coolness Factor" 
(CF) of any given object. An example of something with a high CF 
would be the Sun Sparc 10 50-1 with 128megs of RAM and other 
extra goodies. This device has a high enough CF that Uncle Ira will set 
an unreasonable price for it. Most likely, it will sit on his desk until it 
depreciates to the price of a Happy Meal. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Also beware items with a high "luminosity." Want that terminal 
server? It has so many lights that when you flick the switch, a room 
still has more than ample reading light. Much luminosity! It's almost  
guaranteed to be way out of your price range. It would require ninja-
like skill for anyone to pimp smack it out of Ira's possession.
