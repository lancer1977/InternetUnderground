Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to scour the Net for filth...As a full-time job.

It's a dirty job--in every sense of the word--but somebody's gotta do it. 
In order for 
services that filter the Internet to work, some employee has to rake 
through all that muck on the Web, scouting out every last topless photo 
and naughty word. Here at <I>Internet Underground</I>, preoccupied 
with putting together our "Sex issue," we found ourselves wondering: 
What kind of a job would that be? What would it pay? And what would it 
do to any sane person? 
<P>
Well, it turns out that the job's called  "Internet Content Supervisor." 
The pay? $7 per hour. 
<P>
The service that employs these smut blockers is N2H2, an ISP in 
Seattle which bills itself as "the leader in Internet filters." N2H2 runs by 
the philosophy that subscribing to a blocked Internet service should be 
an option for people who want it. Their 
children's service, <A HREF="http://www.bess.net">Bess</A>, is a "safe" launching point for 
youngsters to explore the Net without stumbling across porn or hate 
speech. Their service for businesses, Birddog, restricts workers from 
accessing certain categories of sites that their employer deems 
inappropriate. Far from judgmental, N2H2 also sells unrestricted access 
to the Net. Basically, they'll 
provide you with any level of freedom that 
you desire. 
<P>
N2H2's offices in Seattle employ several blockers, most of whom 
work the job part-time in order to pursue other things. Many of the 
employees are struggling filmmakers; the joke around the office is that 
the whole bizarre experience is great script fodder. For this month's 
FAQ, <I>IU</I> conducted an interview with an N2H2 employee, who 
preferred that his name not be used in the piece.

<FONT COLOR=003D84><I><B>IU</B>: So what's the nitty-gritty of your job? 
How do you go about it?</I></FONT><BR>
It's gotten pretty much cut-and-dried these days. They basically have a 
program with every dirty word they can imagine. It goes through all the 
search programs and makes a list of every page that registers those 
words. 
<P>
<FONT COLOR=003D84><I><B>IU</B>: Then you personally go check out 
anything that's suspect?</I></FONT><BR>
Yeah, they have a whole crew of people that just sit there and go 
through the pages. To find out whether or not it has violence, gore, sex, 
hate speech, illegal stuff like hacking information, anything drug-related, 
stuff you wouldn't want kids to see. 
<P>
<FONT COLOR=003D84><I><B>IU</B>: What about a site that presents medical information, perhaps on 
AIDS or reproduction?</I></FONT><BR>
It all depends on how graphic it is. It's hard to say without knowing the 
language. Does the site cross the line between being informative and 
being the kind of thing that little kids in junior high are going to be 
crowded around at the library computer?It's subjective. 
<P>
<FONT COLOR=003D84><I><B>IU</B>: What about political activism?</I></FONT><BR>
As long as it isn't hate-related, then it's OK. We had a big moral debate 
one day because I ran into a historical revisionism page. Many of us 
thought that was worse than pornography. But it's really sketchy. They're 
not explicitly advocating genocide--they're saying, "The Holocaust was a 
myth, we'll show you how the photos were doctored, here are the lies in 
what the so-called survivors said, and we can prove that it never 
happened."
<P>
<FONT COLOR=003D84><I><B>IU</B>: So you let that stay?</I></FONT><BR>
Well, what tends to happen with most of those is that you look around 
long enough and somewhere there's something that crosses the 
boundary between history and saying, "These people have got to be out 
of the country."That would cause us to block. 
<P>
<FONT COLOR=003D84><I><B>IU</B>: Do you have strict written guidelines about what to block?</I></FONT><BR>
Not really...It's kind of understood after 
working there awhile and seeing the lists of objectionable words. But it's 
kind of weird, because after working there a couple of months, 
somebody will mention they're seeing this site and they don't know we're 
supposed to be blocking it. It still needs some organization. For 
instance, there are a lot of violent video games that none of us play. I've 
never seen the game Quake, but I guess people get blown away in it or 
something. So, they block that, for the gore. And for a while, none of us 
knew! Someone had been working there for a couple of months, and 
commented that it was irritating that these pages kept coming up. And 
we said, "Oh, that's because you're supposed to be getting rid of them." 
The basics of the job is just that you look through these things and 
decide whether to let them go or not. At the bottom of the page, it gives 
you a menu that lets you rate it, and you click "good" or "bad." 
<P>
<FONT COLOR=003D84><I><B>IU</B>: Do you block a site as soon as 
you see an age verification page, or do 
you look at the page?</I></FONT><BR>
I tend to block as soon as I get to a warning page. There are a lot of 
times that you see a page and it's obvious what's going to come up 
next. But what surprises you, more often, is when you find just a bunch 
of numerals and they all say .gif. You have no idea what you're going to 
click on, but you have to at least 
click on something to find out what it's a 
directory of. <BR>
I've gotten to the point where I don't particularly want to see very 
much. And I had just kind of assumed that most of the other adults I 
was working with would feel the same way. But one of the women I 
work with was complaining that there wasn't really very much porn for 
women out there, that she had been hoping to find more of interest to 
her. Which really shocked me.
In a way, it can be interesting, but--I don't know. I think it can mess 
people up. So I try to see as little of it as possible, although it's 
inevitable that you're going to run into some.   
<P>
<FONT COLOR=003D84><I><B>IU</B>: So it's having an effect on you?</I></FONT><BR>
It's starting to. I think that's part of why I've been in a solemn mood all 
week. Finally, my boss said yesterday, "If you want to take some time 
off, you can," and I was just about to ask. So I took off this afternoon. 
I've just been nasty all week, I've been in this horrible mood, but ever 
since I left work this afternoon, I felt really good. 
It's such a repetitive job. You just sit there for four hours or eight 
hours or however long. Even if it's not porn, it's looking through all these 
things and saying, "OK, is the word 'fuck' here; can I let this go, or do I 
have to find something vile to get rid of this," and it's really repetitive. I 
went to a bookstore after that, and I was looking for a book, and I was 
kind of zoning out. I couldn't remember what book I was looking for 
when I realized I was just looking through shelves for dirty words on the 
covers of books! And I thought, "You can't block this, this is real life. Get 
a grip." 
I remember thinking to myself when I got the job: "If this becomes 
something that I can't get away from when I'm not at work, I have to 
quit." And I think I'm getting to that point now. 
<P>
<FONT COLOR=003D84><I><B>IU</B>: Is it warping your personal life?</I></FONT><BR>
I think it is. Porn is one of those things that is kind of dangerous. You 
can compare it to alcohol or drugs: I think a small amount of it, used 
right, for some people, is OK. But it's really easy to get addicted to it, 
and it's really easy to let it control the way you see things. 
<P>
<FONT COLOR=003D84><I><B>IU</B>: I would think it would be kind 
of overwhelming.</I></FONT><BR>
It's weird; everybody has their different ways of dealing with it. Some of 
the people deal with it way differently than I do, and our methods clash. 
Some people are still really into it; as soon as something comes up that 
they think is really sexy, they say heyyyy and they'll call a few other guys 
over and they'll all have fun looking. And some people just try to joke 
about it, saying, "What a great photographer," talking about the artistic 
merits of someone with a fish inserted somewhere.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=003D84><I><B>IU</B>: Did you just say what I thought you said?</I></FONT><BR> 
Yeah. (laughs) That's out there. I don't remember the URL, but I could 
probably get it for you.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=003D84><I><B>IU</B>: No, thanks, I don't really want it.</I></FONT><BR>
I understand. That's the other thing about the job--it can give you an 
extremely low opinion of humanity. Because there's not an act that 
hasn't been either photographed or described. There are things on dogs, 
children, horses, industrial machines--anything your imagination could 
possibly stray to. After a while, it does get really disgusting. It started 
turning my stomach, which I'm somewhat happy about, because I know 
at least it still bothers me. 
<P>
<FONT COLOR=003D84><I><B>IU</B>: At least you know you're not numb.</I></FONT><BR>
There are such graphic images. There are a lot of porn anime sites, and 
there was one place where I clicked on the next window, and there was 
this stunning--shocking--picture there. I couldn't get it out of my head 
for about a day. It was like a bad song, where no matter what you do 
there's this thing going through your head. Whenever I was bored, this 
picture would come back to me. And I was thinking that if I were 
involved with somebody, it would be so incredibly disgusting to be with 
them sexually, and in the back of your mind have something like that 
start popping up. 
<P>
<FONT COLOR=003D84><I><B>IU</B>: You don't think you could keep 
this job and be in a relationship?</I></FONT><BR>
I was actually dating someone when I started working here. It didn't last, 
but at the time I was still new enough at it that I could kind of divorce 
myself from it. But after all this time at the job, it becomes difficult to 
forget what you've seen. There are definitely a lot of unpleasant things I 
really would rather not have witnessed.
In fact, relating electronically has gotten really gross to me. E-mailing, 
I don't mind, because I know the person on the other end. But getting 
to know someone over the computer has lost all its romance for me. 
And when 
it comes to research, I've had a hard time 
finding anything really valid or interesting. 
<P>
<FONT COLOR=003D84><I><B>IU</B>: What do people think of the 
service you provide?</I></FONT><BR>
A lot of people jump on it, because the moment you tell them what you 
do, they assume it's censorship. Which in a way it is, but people pay 
money so they don't have to look at this stuff. A lot of people get upset 
that it's censored in any way. They think that the people who are 
subscribing don't know what they're missing. 
<P>
<FONT COLOR=003D84><I><B>IU</B>: To me, it just seems like another option. And I'm always in 
favor of more options.</I></FONT><BR>
Yeah, and you can always say it's helping 
create jobs. It's not just destroying the porn industry. It's saying the porn 
industry is helping other people. Like me.
<P>
<FONT COLOR=003D84><I><B>IU</B>: What's your official job title?</I></FONT><BR>
Um, I forget. Oh yeah, it's "Internet Content Supervisor."
<P>
<FONT COLOR=003D84><I><B>IU</B>: OK, but how would you describe it if you met somebody at 
a party?</I></FONT><BR>
At this point, I'd probably just say I worked in data entry. (laughs)
