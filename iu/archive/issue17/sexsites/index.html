<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial, geneva">
<B>On a typical morning in her Tacoma household</B>, Beth Mansfield sends 
her husband off to work and prepares lunch for her two boys. After 
dropping them off at school in the Corolla, she settles into her home 
office to spend yet another day scouring the Internet for the latest
in hot, raunchy, XXX pornography.
<P>
It's a time-consuming process using search engines and following new 
links, but Mansfield is nothing if not diligent.  The finicky former 
accountant divides the free sites from the pay sites, then breaks them 
down by content: hard-core, soft-core, gay, woman-on-woman, and 
various other specialties and permutations less fit to print.
<P>
The uncensored smorgasbord of smut delivered via her T-3 line no 
longer shocks her, although she says she certainly hasn't developed a 
taste for it. She'd rather look at her needlepoint or the pictures her sons 
have drawn that hang on the walls of the dining room, which doubles as 
her 
home office. 
<P>
"I'm probably the strangest adult cruiser there is. I go and look at the 
structure (of a site), look at what they offer...count the images...and I'm 
out," Mansfield says. "It's kind of like an OB/GYN type of thing."
<P>
Netizens likely won't recognize the name "Mansfield," but many more 
than will admit it know her online moniker, Persian Kitty. Mansfield is 
the creator and keeper of 
<A HREF="http://www.persiankitty.com">Persian Kitty's Adult Links</A>, a catalog of more than 1,000 hot links to 
pornographic Web pages that has become a veritable Yahoo! of adult 
content. By conservative estimates, 270,000 visitors pop by Persian 
Kitty daily to check the unparalleled list of the lewd and lascivious.
<P>
The traffic makes Persian Kitty an extreme, but not unique, example 
of surprisingly successful adult sites started by innovative, ambitious 
and sometimes unlikely entrepreneurs. While the pundits and 
academics search in vain for how best to turn the Web into gold, these 
small porntrepreneurs are exploiting a simple equation: the newest 
technology + the world's oldest commodity = big money. 
<P>
These bite-size Larry Flynts in turn are mocking the conventional 
wisdom that says the Web is not yet a viable commercial medium. They 
are proving that a site need not cost millions to make millions, and that 
consumers will indeed engage in credit card transactions via the 
Internet.
<P>
In the case of Persian Kitty, the site has been lucrative beyond 
Mansfield's wildest fantasies. The home page, which the 36-year-old 
housewife started on a lark 18 months ago, now generates $80,000 a 
month in advertising, 70 percent of it profit. In short, it has been an 
awesome trip for Mansfield, who launched Persian Kitty simply "to see 
how many people I could bring into my corner of 
the Web."
<P>
"I feel like I've won the lottery," says Mansfield, who plans to invest 
the profits in a larger house and a minivan. "I guess 
I was just in the right place at the 
right time."
<P>
Mansfield is not the only one cashing in on online pornography. PC 
Meter reports that of the 20 most popular Web sites, two are adult sites 
(they are the only two of the 20 that charge visitors). Of the top 500 
sites that get 1 percent or more of the traffic, 50 are adult sites. Put it 
this way--the "cybererotica" site ranks as the 
14th most popular, one slot above <A HREF="http://www.Disney.com">www.Disney.com</A>.
<P>
Various theories are bandied about to explain pornography's 
disproportionate standing on the Internet. One is universally agreed 
upon: Adult sites don't just sell easy access, they sell anonymous 
access. "You don't need sunglasses and a trench coat when you're 
surfing the Net," said Greg Wester, research director for the Boston-
based Yankee Group.
<P>
The popularity should come as little surprise given that pornography 
has driven the adoption of numerous other technologies, such as the 
video camera and video-on-demand. It is also widely thought that VCRs 
were initally brought into the home to watch dirty flicks. Only after this 
introduction did the technology become as much a part of the family as 
the dog.
<P>
"This is the typical technology adoption cycle," says Kate Delhagen, 
an analyst with Forrester Research Inc. "Who knows, maybe the people 
who are giving their credit cards now to buy (online pornography) will 
eventually give them to buy flowers for their wives."
<P>
Perhaps less typical of the cycle is the early success of individual 
entrepreneurs who have little experience in the field, and less financial 
backing. Take the case of  <A HREF="http://www.Janey.com">www.Janey.com</A>, which Steph Huntington 
started in February of 1996 as a way merely to test his prowess with 
HTML 
coding.
<P>
 Huntington initially posted a home page featuring eight provocative, 
but fully-clothed, pictures he had taken of his wife Janey. He did so as 
an interim and experimental  effort before he built the page that was his 
ultimate goal--an explanation of the international standards for 
environmental and quality management.
<P>
The Huntingtons, however, soon realized they were on to something 
with Janey.com. Janey spread word of the page on IRC channels and 
within a couple of weeks, the page had registered 20,000 hits. (To this 
day, Steph says he hasn't gotten one hit on his environmental standard 
page).
<P>
Janey.com, meanwhile, has blossomed into one of the Web's 
dominant "amateur" sites. It attracts 14,000 visitors a day who come to 
see topless pictures of Janey, a 45-year-old grandmother of two, and 
more hard-core images of other non-professional 
models, including housewives, college students, a lifeguard and a 
waitress from Hooters. 
<P>
As with Persian Kitty's Adult Links, Janey's traffic has translated into 
big advertising dollars. The Huntingtons say that they earn between 
$8,000 and $10,000 a month selling banner advertising space. Most 
of the space is purchased by larger adult sites, although there is one 
pizza restaurant advertising delivery. The couple also makes money 
selling the models' pictures ($6 for six photos) and their bras and 
panties. The panties go for $30 each and come with a picture and a 
personalized note.
<P>
Lest you get the idea the Huntingtons merely backed into their 
success, understand that Steph, a retired executive, has undertaken to 
run it as a full-fledged business operation. In one bedroom in their four-
bedroom house in Diamond Bar, Calif., the couple houses several 
powerful Unix Apache servers, with Pentium Pro 200 brains and 256 
megabytes of memory each. The Huntingtons sell space on the servers 
to other adult sites, a source of an additional $4,000 a month in 
revenue. 
<P>
The Huntingtons have bigger plans still. They are launching a new pay 
site called Private Reserve that will charge $15 to $20 each month for 
more hard-core pornography. They also plan to offer videoconferencing 
and pay-per-view sex.
<P>
While Steph runs the business side, Janey personally responds to 
each of the 150 e-mails she receives each day. She also takes time to 
wear every pair of panties before she mails them out, which can 
become time-consuming considering she sold $1,700 worth of 
undergarments in February alone. She said the effort explains the 
reason for the success of Janey.com: Consumers of pornography want a 
personal touch, not necessarily anonymous hard-core imagery. 
<P>
 "I can't tell you how many guys are lonely or 
suicidal or by themselves who write," says Janey. "I think there are a lot 
of lonely people out there I can help."
<P>
A similar philosophy underlies the efforts of <A HREF="http://www. danni.com">Danni's 
Hard Drive</A>, a site aggressively run by stripper Danni 
Ashe. The Hard Drive features pictures of Ashe, 29, her officemates, 
and images she presciently licensed from magazines called 
<I>Naughty Neighbors</I> and <I>Score</I>.
<P>
Ashe expects the 2-year-old site to gross $2 million in revenue next 
year, largely from charging $9.95 in monthly subscriptions. She said the 
Hard Drive gets 3.5 million hits a day.
<P>
Like Janey, Ashe believes smaller pornography sites can compete 
because they give visitors a sense of intimacy. At the same time, Ashe 
also agrees with Steph that it will get more and more difficult for small 
sites to establish themselves. "The (door) isn't closing for the little guy, 
but it's getting more and more difficult," says Ashe. "It's harder and 
harder to get seen unless you spend a lot on advertising."
<P>
One gets the feeling Ashe will continue to fare well. A perfectionist 
and aggressive businesswoman, Ashe runs the Hard Drive out of a 
business park in Los Angeles with the zeal of Bill Gates taking on 
Netscape. To publicize the site, for example, she trades for advertising 
space in magazines like D-Cup and Juggs by doing photo shoots for 
them. It is a 
business model she pioneered.
<P>
She has also managed to attract 
copious mainstream press. She has been interviewed by Roger Ebert, 
and appeared in such diverse publications as <I>Interactive Week</I> 
and the <I>Los Angeles Business Journal</I>. The attention is far 
different from what she was accustomed to in a decade of stripping.
<P>
"The other day, my husband and I were at the newsstand and we 
were looking at (pictures of me in) computer magazines, not titty 
magazines," she said. "It's very strange."
<P>
Ashe will not disclose her profit margin. It is evident, however, that 
unlike Persian Kitty or Janey, Ashe's use of professional models and her 
more aggressive operation eats into the profits.
 <P>
Still, she is smaller than the heavy hitters from the porn industry that 
increasingly are making their presence felt on the Web. Major 
magazines, video houses and, in particular, phone sex companies are 
weighing in with slick, multimillion-dollar Web sites.
<P>
Seth Warshavsky's Internet Entertainment Group, an offshoot of his 
once $70 million-dollar phone sex operation, spent $3 million 
developing 12 sites, including <A HREF="http://www.clublove.com">ClubLove</A> and  <A HREF="http://www.girlsgirlsgirls.com">GirlsGirlsGirls</A>. His Seattle office has an 
administrative staff of 25 and it consumes $350,000 a month in 
overhead.
<P>
He is approaching the Internet as pornography's next great medium, a 
portable storefront that brings buyers of sex exactly what they want, 
exactly when they want it. He projects the company's revenue at $20 
million next year. To position itself, IEG has made numerous 
investments, creating partnerships to broadcast the live conferencing for 
Penthouse magazine, and to provide 
Web services to the major XXX movie houses, Vivid Video and Seymore. 
IEG has also licensed the exclusive Internet conferencing rights to eight 
of the biggest porn stars.
<P>
He even speaks of Internet pornography in terms of big business. 
"We've been very successful about tying up content and real estate," 
says Warshavsky, possibly referring to the contracts with the porn stars. 
"There's not a lot of people entering the market like we have."
<P>
The presence of big players is double edged for the smaller 
porntrepreneurs. On the one hand, it represents obvious competition. 
On the other hand, the advertising spent by the big players helps keep 
smaller sites in the black. Not including the $100,000 it spends in print 
media, IEG pours $200,000 a month into Internet advertising. Its 
banners appear on about 1,600 Web sites, including a number of 
smaller sites. 
<P>
The big sites have also helped drive the technology, which could be 
good for the industry as a whole, according to entrepreneurs of all sizes. 
For example, IEG is pioneering new video conferencing technology. It 
has begun to license its 24-hour live sex sessions to any and all other 
adult sites in exchange for 50 percent of the profits.
<P>
"We don't feel like we're competing with them at all," Huntington said. 
"They've been a good friend to us."
<P>
As for Mansfield, well, she's worried all of the time. She constantly 
fears that someone will create a better list of links, or a more popular 
service. "I'm afraid to relax because I'm afraid it could all go away 
tomorrow," she says. "It may be that in two years I'll be pounding the 
pavement looking for work."
<P>
So for the time being, the unlikeliest porntrepreneur of them all will 
continue to put in 12-hour days, checking sites, hunting down the latest 
adult content, making sure her servers are up, running a site whose 
name, despite its provocative implication, comes from Mansfield's 
Persian cat.
<P>
"If Smokey only knew," she says.
