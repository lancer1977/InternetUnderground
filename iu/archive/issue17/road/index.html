Summer's almost here and the time is right for, well, getting away from 
it all. If you're about to wrap up a grueling year at the academy or have 
been putting in too many hours hacking away at work, 
summer is the time to hang it up and kick it back for a while.
<P>
But you know what they say: When you have the money to travel, you 
don't have the time and vice versa. Well, that's no longer true. Today, 
thanks to the Internet, savvy adventurers can travel to 
distant lands for less than ever, and even find ways to stay there on the 
cheap. 
<P>
Beyond helping travelers save money, the Net is helping people travel 
with better, more up-to-date information. And it's helping them stay in 
touch with friends and family while they travel, which can also ease the 
budget--it's much cheaper to send e-mail than to try to connect by 
phone.
<P>
But enough jabbering--you're itching to hit the road, so let's 
get started.

<P>
<BR>
<B>COMPILING YOUR OWN CUSTOM GUIDEBOOK</B>
<P>
Rather than going to a bookstore and buying a guidebook filled mostly 
with information you'll never use, why not use the Net to compile a 
personal guidebook? If you know where you want to go and are 
interested in some suggestions about what to see, try <A HREF="http://www.fodors.com">Fodor's Personal 
Trip Planner</A>. Say you want to go to Santa Fe, N.M. Select the city 
from a list, click through categories like Where to Stay and Eating Out, 
then hit Create My Miniguide. You'll have a custom guide to Santa Fe, 
based on your interests.
<P>
If you want the Net's help in picking your next vacation spot, 
try <A HREF="http://travel.epicurious.com/traveler/concierge/concierge.html">Conde Nast's Concierge</A>. You put in your interests, what you can 
afford and when you want to travel. Based on these and other 
preferences, the Concierge will offer a few suggestions for where to 
spend your vacation. For example, I told the Concierge that I'd like to go 
to Southeast Asia in June and that I prefer a temperature range of 70-
85 degrees. In a few seconds the Concierge responded that Bali would 
be an ideal choice and suggested a list of hotels in my budget. While 
you may not want to let a robot dictate your vacation plans, the 
Concierge is a good place to get ideas for your next trip.
<P>
Another superb site for destination information is excite's  
<A HREF="http://city.net">city.net</A>. Click on the world map on the cover page to get to the 
country you're planning on visiting. When Lisa Johnson of San Diego 
learned she'd have to go to Bergen, Norway, on business, she had only 
a week to learn about the city and plan activities for her days off there. 
So she turned to city.net, where she found a wealth of information on 
Bergen and western Norway. Said her husband John: "No doubt right 
now she's on a fjord cruise using the information we pulled off city.net's 
page on Bergen tours. She's planning to take the 'Norway in a Nutshell' 
tour we got from city.net. Without the Net, there's no way we could have 
done in-depth research on such short notice, and it saved us the cost 
of a $20 Fodor's book that has more detail than we wanted."
<P>
Some established guidebook companies have made the jump to the 
Web, and millions of travelers are flocking to these sites before taking 
off on their trips. <A HREF="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/">Lonely Planet</A> and The 
<A HREF="http://www.hotwired.com/rough/">Rough Guides </A>, two guidebook companies that budget travelers 
have relied on for years, are among the best. These sites offer a 
tremendous amount of information, to the point where many travelers 
may opt to save a few bucks by printing out the information 
they need rather than buying 
the guidebook.
<P>
Richard Trillo of The Rough Guides doesn't believe the RG site, which 
includes the full text of some of RG's titles, will hurt sales. "Why would 
anyone want sheaves of computer printouts stapled together when they 
can get the beautiful book? Long live the book." Despite Trillo's faith in 
hard copy, many travelers (like the Johnsons, mentioned above) are 
already cherry-picking the best information from online sites. Others buy 
the book and supplement it with printouts from 
the Net.
<P>

<B>GETTING THERE CHEAPLY</B>
<P>
OK, now you know where you're going and want to get there as 
cheaply as possible. In the old days, you could hang out at an airport 
hoping to get a cheap standby 
ticket. Unfortunately, those days 
are over, but by using the Net 
effectively, you can save a bundle on air travel.
<P>
For a quick getaway, consider last-minute discount fares like Net 
SAAver fares from <A HREF="http://www.americanair.com">American Airlines</A>. Each 
Wednesday, American sends out dozens of eleventh-hour deals to cities 
in the U.S. and abroad. Typically, the domestic trips must begin the 
following Friday evening or Saturday and return anytime the following 
Monday or Tuesday.
<P>
Note: You can learn about Net SAAver fares at American's site or by 
subscribing to the Net SAAver weekly e-mail newsletter--see the site for 
details about subscribing.
<P>
Fares are typically less than half of standard low fares; witness a 
round-trip fare of $129 for travel between Chicago and Boston. During 
off-peak travel seasons, Net SAAver offers package deals on 
international routes like a six-day, five-night trip to London, including 
airfare, a first-class hotel, and breakfast each day, for $499. Other 
airlines, such as <A HREF="http://www.usair.com">USAir</A>, have similar programs. To 
save money on hotels, see <A HREF="http://www.travelweb.com">Click-It! Weekends</A> where similar last-minute deals are offered at Hyatt 
and other stylish hotels.
<P>
But not everyone can take off at the last minute. To find air schedules 
and prices, see <A HREF="http://expedia.com">Expedia</A> or another major online 
booking service. Put in your travel dates and times, and Expedia will list 
your options. Then click on Best Fare Finder to search for the best fare 
on that route. To keep tabs on the best fares to the places you'd like to 
travel, sign up with Expedia's Fare Tracker and tell it which three routes 
you'd like updates on. For example, if you live in Seattle, type in 
Seattle-San Francisco, Seattle-Los Angeles, and Seattle-New York. 
Each week, Fare Tracker will send e-mail updates on the cheapest fares 
for each route.
<P>
For international air travel, the best bet is finding a consolidator. Sites 
such as <A HREF="http://www.flifo.com">Flifo</A> and <A HREF="http://www.tiss.com">TISS</A> have 
consolidator fares, but no site has them all. These fares are special 
discounted fares, offered "under the table," and cannot be included in 
the major computer reservation systems. They're perfectly legitimate, 
but the Net isn't always the best place to find them. Try the Sunday 
travel section of a good metro newspaper or a travel 
agent who's well connected 
with consolidators.
<P>
But don't overlook sites that can save you money on international 
travel. <A HREF="http://www.cathay-usa.com">Cathay Pacific</A>, for example, has 
periodic auctions through its Web site, offering tickets to the highest 
bidders. Cathay is planning to auction another 1,000 tickets this year, 
having staged three successful auctions last year. During last summer's 
auction, some of the winning bidders flew round-trip from New York or 
Hong Kong for under $800. Cathay encourages visitors to sign up for its 
Cybertraveler program, and occasionally sends e-mail updates offering 
special deals to these Cybertravelers. These deals have been challenged 
as discriminatory against those who don't own a computer, but so far, 
none of the challenges have succeeded. Other airlines have similar 
programs. For a list of links to hundreds of airlines, see <A HREF="http://www.itn.net/airlines">Airlines of the Web</A>. 

Finally, for ultracheap--or even free--international travel, consider flying as an air courier. Here's how it 
works: you give up your baggage allowance and travel with a carry-on 
bag. A rep from an air courier company meets you at the airport, checks 
in baggage under your name, and gives you your tix. Sometimes you 
have to meet a rep at the other end to release the bags, then you're 
free to go. Typically, you can stay up to 14 or 30 days, depending on 
the deal you work out with the courier company. 
To find out about courier deals online, see 
<A HREF="http://www.courier.org">Air Courier Travel</A> or the <A HREF="http://www.wallstech.com">Worldwide Courier Association</A>, probably the only budget travel site with a video clip of 
Robin Leach.
<P>
Sang Kwon, a student who flew to Thailand on a courier deal, found 
out about courier flights through a Yahoo! search, but wasn't sure at 
first if the fares were legit. "After seeing examples of some of the fares 
being offered, I truly thought it was a scam. So I investigated a bit more 
and found several articles written by netizens and travel publications 
concerning air courier services. I was thoroughly satisfied with my flight, 
especially knowing I paid less than half what everyone else on the plane 
paid for the very same flight."

<B>THE PERSONAL CONNECTION</B>
<P>
As seasoned Net-users know, the Net is much more than the World 
Wide Web. While the Web 
is wonderful, it's pretty much 
a one-way medium. Sure, some Web sites have nice conference 
areas 
(<A HREF="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/feedback/comp.htm">Lonely Planet's Traveling Companions</A>  is among the best for 
hooking up with other adventurers), but the Web isn't the best place to 
get opinions from other travelers. Newsgroups and listservs are.
<P>
There are newsgroups out there for just about any interest. And 
thankfully, you don't have to wade through the thousands of groups to 
look for the right one. Just go to 
the Web site <A HREF="http://www.dejanews.com">DejaNews</A>, where you can put in your key words--for example, 
"camping AND Maine"--and get back a list of newsgroups where you can 
find out about camping in Maine. Then read the articles or post some 
questions of your own, and if you're specific and polite, you should hear 
back from 
fellow travelers.
<P>
When Ami Claxton wanted information about hotels in Rome, she first 
did some research on the Web, then turned to the newsgroup 
rec.travel.europe asking for comments about the hotels she was 
considering. Ami received about 20 e-mail messages from all over the 
world, mostly from people who had recently been to Rome. And many 
who responded offered tips about what to see and do while there. "The 
Usenet community is a fabulous source of information," she says. "Very 
often, people who wrote had just returned within the past month, so 
that the information was timely and relevant. It's also much cheaper 
than buying a guidebook or making international phone calls to people 
who may not speak English. These are just regular people (most times) 
who are trying to help you enjoy your experience. They have no financial 
stake in where you stay or visit."
<P>
But don't take opinions off Usenet as gospel. Somebody might like a 
place that doesn't suit you, or a proprietor of a cheap hotel could make 
it sound like a palace. So look for patterns, as Claxton did, basing her 
choice on several recommendations for the same hotel. Once she 
selected the hotel, she used e-mail to negotiate a discount. "Here are 
some reasons to give us a lower price," she wrote in her message. "We 
found you on the Web; we will stay for six nights during low tourist 
season; we are staying over a weekend; and we are very nice!" After 
going back and forth a couple of times, the hotel agreed to knock more 
than 20 percent off the rate previously quoted.
<P>

<B>THE NET AS LIFELINE</B>
<P>
When you're on the road, especially on a long trip, the Net can be a 
virtual lifeline, offering updated travel information and keeping you 
connected with other travelers. When Jim Klima decided to travel 
through Africa and Asia, he turned to the Net's newsgroups and listservs 
(e-mail lists) for advice. 
<P>
"Before leaving, I prowled every travel-
related discussion group I could find to locate people who had actually 
done an overland trip," Klima said. "Since few Americans travel this way, 
using the Net gave me access to Europeans and Australians who had 
firsthand experience. I received very good feedback, both negative and 
positive, about overlanding in general and specific (trucking) companies 
in particular. It also gave me a splendid opportunity to query these 
people about what equipment and precautions I should take." 
<P>
Note: To find listservs, see <A HREF="http://www.liszt.com">Liszt</A> where you can find 
listservs that match your interests.
<!--fuck you sahpiro for all these URLs-->
<P>
Once on the road, Klima used e-mail to get key information for his 
journey. "We used e-mail to ask Lonely Planet about release dates for 
new editions of the guidebooks for Pakistan and Central Asia and who 
the local distributors were in Nairobi and Islamabad. We got both in 
Nairobi, which really saved our butts--going into these areas blind would 
have been much 
more difficult." 
<P>
When Klima and his wife became ill in India, they used e-mail to keep 
friends and family abreast of their return plans "which evolved as our 
illnesses did." Calling from India would have been expensive and 
impractical, he said, so they found a little long-distance shop that sent 
e-mail for 60 rupees (just under $2 a page).
<P>
As Klima and many others have found, the Net can be a great way to 
save some money. But the benefits extend far beyond finding good 
deals. Through online resources, travelers are finding they can get just 
the information they want, hear honest opinions from other travelers 
and stay in touch with the home front more easily. And they're finding 
that planning their trips, from finding rail schedules to getting advice 
about hostels, can be almost as enjoyable as the trip itself.
