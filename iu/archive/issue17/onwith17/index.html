<B>It seems like every time</B> you turn on the TV nowadays, there is another 
cloying ad from AT&T or Microsoft or  MCI or Philips Magnavox, or some other 
big corporate bozo trying to sell their "version" of the Internet. You know 
the commercials. Sappy background music. A Don Pardo sound-a-like tugging 
mercilessly at your heart strings. The screen flashes some absurd scene, 
like starving children in Bangladesh teleconferencing with Sally Struthers 
(cut to the next scene), while a businessman hits the enter key, sits back 
contentedly in his chair, and waits for $700 billion of that easy Internet 
money to transfer to his bank account (cut to the next scene), and Grandma 
and Grandpa receive an e-mail finger painting, look lovingly into each 
other's eyes, and bless the technology they've lived to enjoy. Welcome to 
the Internet middle America...courtesy of the geniuses on Madison Avenue.

Such visual inanity is why it is worth giving the folks at Lotus some 
credit. Who cares if Lotus Domino, their entry into the Internet and 
Intranet Web server market, is any good? Even if the product name 
conjures images of  a large pepperoni and mushroom more than it does 
a Netscape or Microsoft competitor, Lotus still scored big time, just by 
having the guts to hire Denis Leary as their pitchman.
<P>
Yup. Denis Leary. The raving, nicotine fit, screw-the-PC-crowd, 
comedian/actor with the Marlboro voice. The guy who summed up the 
'70s in his one-man stand-up comedy show, <I>No Cure for 
Cancer</I>, this way: "There we were in the middle of the sexual 
revolution wearing clothing that guaranteed we wouldn't get laid." The 
Denis Leary whose take on the '80s was, "That was the only good thing 
about the '80s--we got rid of one of the Bee Gees. One down, three to 
go. That's what I say, folks." 
<P>
Oh, and Leary's message for the techno-hyped '90s? "If you want to 
surf, go to Maui!" 
<P>
Or so he says in one of his Lotus commercials, the one where he 
paces around a cybercaf&eacute; filled with cyberhipsters (read: 
dorky-looking actors and actresses), and asks, "You know what I am 
sick of hearing about?" 
<P>
"The Internet," someone replies. "The Internet," another echoes. "The 
Internet!" Leary confirms, as he walks past a vitamin-deficient Lyle 
Lovett look-alike with a big, red pompadour. "Nice hair," he says 
sarcastically. "A zillion dollars worth of technology and what are we 
doing with it?" Leary rants. "Browsing," a lady replies. Leary looks 
pissed. 

It is a "don't give me any bull" kind of pissed. The kind of approach 
that resonates with his fans, whether he is giving his thoughts on 
racism: "I think Rodney King said it best when he said 'Ow, ow, ow, 
ow, '" or evaluating his own films via RealAudio at his official Web site 
(www.celebsites.com/DenisLeary) like <I>Operation Dumbo 
Drop</I>. ("Giant piece of shit! Huge piece of shit! Unless you are like 
four. Then maybe you'd enjoy it. It started out as a good idea, and 
ended up as a giant pile of elephant shit.")
<P>
You have to give Lotus credit for bringing this guy in to pitch their 
product. The fact is, there <I>is</I> a lot of bull on the Internet. 
And frankly, the Lotus ads make more sense than Leary's 1993 ads for 
Nike. You know, hire a guy to hawk your athletic shoes after he boasts 
in his stand-up act, "I love to smoke. I smoke 7,000 packs a day, OK? 
And I am never fucking quitting!"
<P>
So, you show up to interview Leary at the New York offices for his 
production company, Apostle Pictures, and you are expecting to meet a 
chain-smoking wise-ass with a one-liner about everything. You have 
instructions to get him to rant about the Internet like a trained seal. 
Instead, Leary is worn out, looking forward to the vacation that begins 
the second the interview is over, and he is dogged by a serious cold. 
<P>
Perhaps it is his frantic schedule. He has several projects scheduled 
for release, including <I>Wag the Dog</I> with Robert DeNiro and 
Dustin Hoffman, and <I>Suicide Kings</I>, where he stars opposite 
Christopher Walken. In addition, he is busy preparing new material for 
a one-man stand-up show, which will appear on HBO later this year. 
On this day, Leary is doped up on cold medicine, but he hangs in there 
to offer a serious thought or two about the Internet, his official Web 
site, oh, and why he should be the spokesman for NyQuil...

Internet Underground: In one of your Lotus TV commercials, you rave 
about how you are sick of hearing about the Internet. Does the hype 
really bug you that much?
</FONT>
<P>
Denis Leary: Yeah, I mean, I am not a computer-savvy guy besides sort 
of knowing how to turn on the computer and use it as a typewriter. So, 
I appreciated the increased technology in that area for a while, and 
then when the Internet thing happened, I primarily used it as a 
research tool. You know? I don't have a lot of down time, anyway, that 
I could spend in chat rooms and stuff like that, not that that would be 
the kind of thing that I would do. And, actually, a friend of mine, an 
actress, Sandra Bullock, who was really heavily into the Internet as 
soon as it took off, would spend a lot of time just talking to people and 
communicating with friends, and I sort of got into it through her, 
because she was telling me how great it was...So, I had an appreciation 
for it, just on the basis of what it was. And I think the Lotus 
commercials kind of summed up my feelings about it, because it is just 
typical human nature that once something gets invented, whether it is 
television or whatever it is, that there is the stuff that you want from it, 
and need from it, and then there are going to be a lot of people out 
there just bullshitting around, and going off into areas that you don't 
need to spend any time on...
<P>
So, what I liked about the commercials, even when they were first 
presented to me, was that the idea was going to be to use the Net for 
what it is good for, instead of getting all of this insane bullshit that 
exists out there...the UFO home pages, and all that stuff. It's the nature 
of the beast, you know?
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>
IU: Have you checked out 
any chat rooms, or some of 
the insane stuff you are 
talking about?
</FONT>
<P>
DL: No. But I have a Web site. So we have an e-mail system, where 
whenever I get the opportunity I can go in and answer people and 
stuff. Even in that, the majority of the people are just regular people, 
but you get the 10 percent, or the 20 percent, who are just--I don't 
know what they are doing! You know? Like insane people in dark 
rooms, with computer 
terminals and nothing else. No friends. No family. No connections to 
the outside world.
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>

IU: The gist of the Lotus 
message is people should use the Internet for what it is 
good for, business?
</FONT>
<P>
DL: Yeah. That's Lotus' message. And I think that includes, for 
instance, my business on the Internet would be film and TV and 
screenwriting. And I think that is what the great thing about it is.
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>

IU: What were you trying 
to accomplish by developing 
your own official Web site?
</FONT>
<P>
DL: The Web site really came out of a number of fans. Two in 
particular have really incredible home pages, but you know, there is 
always that sense that they are skirting these copyright laws and stuff 
like that, and so they were sort of unofficial bootleg sites. And as I got 
more savvy to the Internet, friends of mine would ask me, "Have you 
seen this home page of yours?" And I was like "no," and I would go in 
and check it out, and I realized that they were sort of like up against a 
wall, in terms of getting certain information, or items, or bootleg CDs, 
or European versions of CDs, and stuff like that. And a couple of 
people that I knew, who were actors, had done the same thing. They 
had taken the home page people and sort of invited them in to help 
create this Web site so that everybody had this one place to go.
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>

IU: How much e-mail have you 
been getting from your site?
</FONT>
<P>
DL: We get a lot of e-mail. We get like, jeez, I would say 300 or 400 
pieces a week.
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>

IU: And you actually read through it all?
</FONT>
<P>
DL: Yeah. It is hard. Sometimes I get these chunks of time, where I can 
do all of them. Right now I am like two weeks behind, because my 
schedule has been so insane.
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>

IU: Are the people who write to you electronically typical fans, or are 
they 
different than people who write to you via regular mail?
</FONT>
<P>
DL: I don't know. It is hard to say what a typical fan is. Some people 
obviously just write because they write to every celebrity home page 
they can get a response from. You know what I mean? Because, I 
remember when I was a kid, you would sit down with your friends, 
and write out 20 letters to different athletes. Some of the guys you 
didn't even like--just to get their pictures signed, so you could say to 
your friends, "Hey, I've got this one, this one and this one." It was all 
about quantity, as opposed to quality. And I think the typical fans are 
just generally interested in what is going on, and sort of are happy to 
be able to touch base a little bit.
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>

IU: You mentioned before that you are not very 
computer-savvy. Yet, you do the Lotus commercials. A guy who isn't 
that computer-savvy to be a spokesman about the Net--does that 
amaze you at all?
</FONT>
<P>
DL: No. It doesn't. Because 
I think the no-bullshit approach to it is the way to go. You can use it as 
a tool, for whatever means you need it for. And I am not saying people 
shouldn't go into chat rooms, but if you have ever been in a chat room 
on more than a regular basis, you find that some of the stuff that goes 
on is just insane. People talking for hours about insane things!
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>

IU: One of the best things on your official Web page 
is the RealAudio clips of you rating your own films. 
I learned that The Ref is the "greatest film ever made," while Two if By 
Sea "really fucking sucks." Since you are honest enough to talk about 
your own films that way, could you do the same thing, and give me an 
honest appraisal of your Web site?
</FONT>
<P>
DL: I think we are still building towards where we want to be. So, I 
would say we are all right.
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>

IU: Not the greatest Web site ever made?
</FONT>
<P>
DL: I don't think so. But we eventually will be the greatest Web site 
ever made, and then from there we will go on to control the entire 
planet. That is our goal. We want to go out and blackmail, and take 
over people's minds. That is our ultimate goal.
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>

IU: How did you hook up with celebsites.com, 
the guys behind your site?
</FONT>
<P>
DL: They approached us, because they were already in business with 
Jim Carrey, and Jim and I have the same agent. So, they came to us, 
and said, "Look, what do you guys think about this?" And we said, "We 
have actually been trying to find a way for somebody to have the time 
to create a site for us."
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>

IU: I saw that on the main celebsites.com page. How do you feel about 
being linked to a page where you can win a date with Brad Pitt?
</FONT>
<P>
DL: Ah. I don't think that is particularly my cup of tea. But he needs to 
have a Web page, if anybody needs to have one. I have a Web page. He 
should have a fucking Web page! There is no doubt about that. He 
should probably have three or four.
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>

IU: Are you tracking how many people look 
at the page, and what they are looking at?
</FONT>
<P>
DL: No. But I think the guys from Celebsites do gauge that. You 
know? It always kind of amazes me, when you get behind on the e-
mail, how many fucking pieces of e-mail there are. And a lot of those 
people just say whether they are students, or they work in a job--they 
say it like they have 10 minutes off and they are fucking around with 
their computers between things that they are supposed to be doing at 
work or at school. But some of them you get the sense that they are 
just roaming around the Internet looking for somebody to talk to. You 
know?
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>

IU: Has the Internet been a good place to 
help charities you are involved with?
</FONT>
<P>
DL: It has been pretty good. The show itself (<I>Comics Come 
Home</I>, an annual show broadcast on Comedy Central, each New 
Year's Eve) does very well. The money we make from the broadcast on 
New Year's Eve is surprising...but the good thing about the Web site is 
that people find out about it. Some of them are more interested about 
the next live show, because they might be fans of me, or Janeane 
Garofalo or Jon Stewart, or whoever is involved in the show. But the 
good thing is they find out what the Neely thing is about. (The Cam 
Neely Cancer Foundation and Cam Neely House is a Boston-based 
organization that helps victims of cancer and their families, and is 
named for the Boston Bruins hockey player.) Because if they are 
attracted by the celebrity names, they don't really care what they give 
the money to. And once they find out what they are giving the money 
to, it is a cause, I think, that pretty much affects everybody, on some 
level.
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>

IU: You also spotlight new comedians 
with RealAudio clips, at your site?
</FONT>
<P>
DL: Yeah. To a lesser extent, that is my sort of feeling less guilty about 
some of the guys that I think are great but haven't made it yet. I mean, 
overall, the key thing [about the Web site] is just sort of keeping in 
contact with people, and disseminating information on what is coming 
out next, or filmwise. Or, I am taping another one-man show for HBO 
in the fall, and so, as we go city to city on that tour, I will be able to let 
people know we are coming well in advance, and run contests, and that 
sort of thing.
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>

IU: I know you are a big Boston sports nut, and 
a huge hockey fan. I saw that your favorite Web sites were mostly 
sports like the ESPN site. What do you use the Web for, aside from 
your own site?
</FONT>
<P>
DL: Yeah. I do a lot of sports updates. And a lot of times this stuff, 
especially if you are traveling, keeping updated on trades and drafts [is 
tough]. Like when they do the college draft and stuff for the NFL, 
baseball, even for hockey, the information is like almost always right 
there. Plus, a lot of times when you are watching some sport on 
television, and you get the updates, all you get is the scores. And if you 
can just jump into the Internet, sometimes you get everything you need 
to know in terms of particulars before the papers come out the next 
day. You know? ESPN has got a good one.
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>

IU: Are there things, other than sports, 
you use the Net for?
</FONT>
<P>
DL: I am waiting for, you know, the Kennedy assassination Web site 
discussing and explaining all the possible theories for the Kennedy 
assassination. I would hang out there for hours. You know?
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>

IU: You do stand-up comedy, you act, you 
direct, you write and you have your own film 
production company. You seem to be trying to get your foot into every 
aspect of media. Where does the Internet fit into that bigger world of 
media?
</FONT>
<P>
DL: I don't know. I mean, it looks like eventually it is going to sort of 
overtake all those things. You know what I mean? I mean, realistically 
speaking, you have got to assume that there is going to be a point in 
the not-so-distant future, where things like <I>Premiere</I> 
magazine, <I>Details</I> and <I>Time</I> magazine will all 
<I>just</I> appear on the Web. You know what I mean? It will still 
come out weekly, or monthly, or whatever it is. But you just punch 
them up on the Web and print them out. Otherwise, the difference 
between how fast you can get the stuff there, and how vast the 
audience is, compared to the newsstand, is amazing. You know?
<P>
I guess it will get better quicker, now. A lot of the movie Web sites 
are just terrible. They are like press books that they would give to the 
press when they went to the screening. And there is so much more they 
can do with it. You know? I think that is going to change now. One of 
the hardest things as an actor is when you are publicizing a movie, if 
you decide to publicize it, is then you have to sit in a hotel room and 
do what they call a junket, which is 60 reporters coming in one after 
the other, and asking the same questions. It is boring for the reporters, 
and boring for the actor, and I think eventually the solution for that, 
when the movie people figure it out, is that you can do it live on the 
Internet. You know? Where you can answer questions all at once. You 
are in one place, they are wherever they are. Nobody has to fly. And 
you can get it all done in one session. That is my dream, anyway.
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>

IU: Do you have a message for people sitting in dark rooms playing 
with chat, or looking for conspiracy theory sites?
</FONT>
<P>
DL: I think people like that--if the Net didn't exist they would be doing 
the same thing, with whatever other piece of technology they had. You 
know what I mean? It is impossible to sort of cure them of the curiosity 
they have for minutiae, and for the things that the rest of us might look 
at very briefly, and go, "Yeah, OK." They're nuts. You know?
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>

IU: Speaking of using it for what it is good for, so far, one of the most 
popular uses for the Net has been porn.
</FONT>
<P>
DL: Yeah. I have heard that. It is like <I>Celebrity Skin</I> 
magazine, which has been around now for 10 or 15 years, where they 
get a shot of Michelle Pfeiffer's left nipple, and they blow it up, and 
make it seem like a headline. It is just natural. I am just glad there are 
no shots of me out there.
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>

IU: Seeing as how you have such 
a nasty cold right now, and knowing your material about cold 
medicine, 
I have to ask: Are you on DayQuil right now?
</FONT>
<P>
DL: I am on DayQuil right now, and NyQuil last night. I am just dying 
to do a NyQuil commercial. You know?
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>

IU: On one of your unofficial Web sites, the guy has a banner that says 
"Sponsored by NyQuil."
</FONT>
<P>
DL: Yeah. Right. I remember that site. Yeah. Unfortunately NyQuil is 
afraid to sort of be involved with any celebrities, or have any kind of 
endorsement.
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>

IU: Have you approached them?
</FONT>
<P>
DL: No. I just heard. Whenever you use NyQuil, or a product name, or 
stuff like that, you find out whether you have to get clearance, and you 
also find out what the company's attitude is toward being perceived a 
certain way. There is no question that NyQuil is perceived by all of us 
the same way, which is sort of like, legal drugs. And one of the great 
things--the only good thing about having a cold--is that you get to act 
like a junkie for the week that you have it, because you are allowed to 
take whatever you want, and knock yourself out, so that you can sleep 
your ass off. And during the day, you take legal speed so that you can 
keep going and have your sinuses dried out. It always amazed me that 
NyQuil would be sort of against somebody coming out and saying this 
is the greatest shit in the world! You take one shot, and it knocks you 
out. I mean, that is the point of the product.
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>

IU: As part of your act, when you 
take jokes about the Internet to a non-hardcore audience, does it play 
well?
</FONT>
<P>
DL: Yeah. Surprisingly, most of the people I have bumped into, in 
terms of the Internet, and in terms of the Web site, and even the 
people from Lotus that we did the spots with, were really OK, in terms 
of sense of humor on that kind of stuff. So, so far I haven't had the 
politically correct Internet crowd try to chastise me. I am sure there is 
one. But most of the people that are involved in that seem to have a 
good sense of humor about things. I am sure there are some out there 
who don't.
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>

IU: Has there been feedback as to whether the Lotus commercials are 
working?
</FONT>
<P>
DL: Oh yeah. They love it. They love it. I mean, I was very happy with 
it. I thought they came out very funny. That is my bottom line. As long 
as it is funny, I don't mind endorsing the product and being connected 
to it. You know? But if it is going to be uptight, and not funny, there is 
no point in it, as far as I am 
concerned.
<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=634208>

IU: Well, I was supposed to get you to rant before I walk out of here. 
Rather than try to provoke you, I will just ask. Do you have an 
Internet rant in you?
</FONT>
<P>
DL: If I wasn't on cold medicine, I would probably have one. You 
know what I mean? It is back to being a junkie. I am kind of spaced out 
right now. So, I get permission to be fucked up.
