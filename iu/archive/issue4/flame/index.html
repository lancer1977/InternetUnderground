The Honeymoon is Over
</FONT SIZE=5>
<P>
	For a while, the 'net captured and captivated the imaginations of everyone. Hollywood moguls with fat wallets called 
college students with underdeveloped academic schedules and validated inexcusable amounts of free time with cash to 
scheme up lame movie plots. Unemployed and overeducated 20-somethings rose to a minor sort of celebrity with sites 
that were incisive, inflammatory, rude or idiotic. Nobody really seemed to mind their overinflated senses of self-
importance, since the Web was going to be <I>big</I>. The image of the 'net had a face and it looked like Sandra Bullock. Life 
was good.
<P>
	Now, however, the backlash begins. At some point over the last few months, somebody realized that the 'net had 
more than its share of useless junk and maybe the Web was getting a little more press than it deserved. I agree. Not only 
that, I'll even venture to admit that the Web has more bad than good; the number of unique and revolutionary sites pale 
in comparison to the rampant commercialism, useless vapid tributes to ego, angry rants and staggering mediocrity that 
pollute the rest of the bandwidth. Cool things abound, but the truth is, lameness dominates. And in most of the country, 
you can't even order a pizza yet.
<P>

	This reality, however, hid under a press-fed luster. The Internet wore its title as king of newness nicely. Magazines 
fed the public a smorgasbord of hype, and we stuffed ourselves. It shouldn't surprise us that we now feel sick. Magazines 
such as <I>Entertainment Weekly</I>, which once barreled full speed ahead on the cyberspace bandwagon, now mine the 
weaker aspects of the 'net for humor and even knocked the cyber phenomenon in its year-end review. Journalists such as 
Bob Metcalfe and Stephen Talbott decry the hype in lengthy editorials, and researchers such as the International Data 
Corp. leave a vast Web wasteland peppered with abandoned sites and account cancellations. The reasoning behind the 
'net's expiration? People will go back to their TVs.
<P>

	To some extent, this will probably happen. The Web exploded so quickly that a backlash was inevitable; no system, 
whether it's the Dewey Decimal or the digestive, can sustain an unlimited influx, and TCP/IP proved no exception. 
Technical difficulties abounded. As for quality, nobody would have expected TV to have 500 quality channels right away -- 
it can't even manage a good 50 now -- so expecting the Internet not to have crap is ludicrous. And yes, people 
overestimated the initial business potential of the 'net. Companies dumping hundreds of thousands of dollars into their 
Web sites are, for the time being, wasting their money. The return isn't there. 
<P>



    

	Some people, and some companies, will undoubtedly flee. But there's a deeper appeal to the Internet than departing 
ad dollars could ever eradicate: It's an open medium. Gaps that open will be filled, and it would actually be kind of ideal 
if vacated corporate sites were replaced by individuals. It's becoming easier and easier to put up your own Web page, 
and even if Exxon or Corningware or Toyota never rake in the dough from the Web, it's never been entirely about money 
anyway. It's about communication and information, and both are pretty hard to kill. People who predict the demise of 
the 'net are responding to the same kind of mindless bandwagonism that made the Web bigger than life in the first place. 
The 'net got overhyped; now the pendulum will swing the other way.
<P>
	This might not even be a bad thing. I'm not sure I mind people going back to their TVs, as long as all the people who 
watch <I>Melrose Place</I> will no longer patronize The Spot, and as long as <I>Baywatch</I> renders Babes on the Web irrelevant. 
You could get rid of a lot of mediocrity if you removed the TV cross-section from the Web's demographics. Unfortunately, 
this isn't going to happen either. The reality of the future is this: Companies that spent too much dough (and there are a 
lot of them) will cut back, but the Internet will continue to grow -- just not as fast. People who predict the 'net's death 
don't seem to realize that the Internet and television won't be growing apart -- they'll actually come closer to merging. 
The Information Super-highway, as irritating a term as I think that is, will become a reality. All we're experiencing now is 
a little fright at the altar -- committing to a new technology, after all, is a pretty big step. Not everyone is ready for it, but 
the rest of us are. If you want to go back to the TV, fine. We're not going to wait around.
