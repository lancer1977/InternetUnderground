<FONT COLOR=F48206><B>The topic of buying a computer</B></FONT> is a subject upon which many people have opinions, mostly conflicting. 
After all, making the decision to buy is easy; finding the money is difficult. Now comes the impossible 
part: figuring out which computer to buy. You could rely on computer salespeople to guide you on this 
perilous mission, but this is impractical for two reasons. First, either the salespeople are minimum-wage 
drones who have only a dim perception of what they are selling, or worse, they have been taught just 
enough techno-jargon to fool the layman into believing they know what they are talking about. In the 
course of my 
travels, I overheard one salesman tell a credulous customer that Packard Bell was 
a division of Hewlett-Packard. After 
surreptitiously setting the customer straight, I chatted up the salesman, and discovered that he truly 
believed that this was the case. (For the clueless salesman out there, these two companies have nothing to 
do with 
each other.) 
<P>
  The second reason sales- people are useless in helping you buy a computer is that they are highly biased 
by things you don't know about. Management may make a priority of selling a particular product because 
the manufacturer is offering a "spiff" for each product sold. Spiff is a polite word for kickback, and 
politicians who accept them usually go to jail (if caught), but salesmen get to be "Salesman of the Month." 
Spiffs are paid to the salesman who makes the sale (in the case of commissioned sales help), or to the 
company. So, given the choice between recommending two computers to you -- one that fits your need 
perfectly, and one that doesn't, but puts $50 in the salesman's/company's pocket -- which do you think 
will be recommended?
<P>

  So, finding yourself in such an untenable position, you might look kindly upon assistance in the form of 
unbiased (unbiased by marketing flaks, that is) recommendations from a computer technician with a 
writing sideline, who can point out  the pitfalls and hidden agendas of the computer industry, and 
hopefully guide you to a purchase which won't sit in a corner and snicker at you for the next five years 
(like that NordicTrack you bought last year). 
<P>
  With that in mind, I went out and did your homework for you -- well, some of your homework. Since 
buying a computer is a pretty broad subject, one which could conceivably consume reams of pages and 
millions of words, we are going to have to narrow the scope a bit. We are going to discuss the minimum 
tools needed to get on the 'net, with an eye toward used equipment so as to preserve your financial 
resources.

<FONT COLOR=F48206><B>For</B></FONT> those of you with money (or a credit card with a cherry credit line), I recommend two very good 
computer systems which contain the USDA recommended amount of silicon needed to get you wired into 
the data stream. These systems are not the cheapest, nor are they the most expensive, but they do have 
the best mix of features, performance and warranty for the money.
<P>
 Compaq Presario 7180: The 7180 is one of the best all-around machines for the money, providing you 
with a CD-ROM drive, a 14.4K FAX/modem, and enough RAM, disk space and sound capability to get 
you online. The software mix is useful, the hardware reliable and the warranty one of the best in the 
industry (three years, one year on-site, with the second and third year 
covering parts only). Compaq offers 800 tech support seven days a week, 24 hours a day. The 7180 goes 
for around $1,900.
<P>
  The 7180 does not come with a monitor, so you will need to add one. The most likely candidate is the 
Compaq 14SV which can be had for about $300, but you can find cheaper monitors. 
Just remember to specify a non-interlaced monitor with a dot pitch of at least .28mm, or your eyes 
will hate you.
<P>
  Apple PowerPC 6200CD:The best buy of the bunch, with everything you need INCLUDING the 
monitor. If you are interested in ease of use and easy-to-install peripherals, then Apple is the way to go. 
The only real disappointment is the one-year warranty.

<FONT COLOR=F48206><B>All</B></FONT> right, so money is an object. Lower your expectations a bit, and you can still do quite well. The best 
thing to look out for is a used system, preferably a major brand name like IBM, Compaq or Apple. 
Obviously, an IBM XT or an Apple IIc is going to be hard pressed to run today's 'net software and handle 
high speed modems, so you need to look at somewhat newer hardware. On the PC side of the equation, 
you need at least a 386 system, 4MB of RAM, a 120MB hard drive and Windows 3.1. On the Apple side, 
a Mac with similar storage specs should fit the bill.
<P>
  If you cruise your local classifieds or the pages of a publication like Computer Shopper, you will find lots 
of old equipment for sale. One highly versatile system I have recommended for a number of people has 
centered around the Compaq Aero laptop computer. The Aero is the Rodney Dangerfield of the laptop 
world, with computer pundits bitching about its small keyboard and missing floppy drive. The keyboard 
is nothing to write home about, but you can get used to it in a day or two. Compaq corrected the second 
shortcoming, and shipped an external floppy with later versions of the model. The Aero came in a 
monochrome version (with either an 84MB or a 170MB hard drive) or a color version (with a 250MB 
drive). The monochrome unit had a 486-25 CPU, 4MB of RAM, Par/Ser ports, a PCMCIA slot (Type II) 
DOS and Windows. I have seen the 84MB model advertised for as little as $550, which if you add a nice 
28.8K modem to the package would put the total price in the $800 range -- not bad for a low cost starter 
system that still has Compaq's three-year warranty to back it up.
<P>
  Why is this laptop so cheap? Because, while it was a decent little computer, Toshiba, IBM and NEC 
were putting out better models for the same money. So, why shouldn't you buy the "better" models 
instead of the Aero? Because the better models still cost $1,300 and up, while the Aero now costs half as 
much due to lack of demand.
<P>
  Similar deals can be found for similar reasons on IBM's PS/1 series of computers, Compaq's Prolinea and 
Deskpro models, and Apple's early PowerMacs. Most systems will be sold without monitors, and while 
you can use monochrome monitors if you must, color is highly advised.

<FONT COLOR=F48206><B>That</B></FONT> brings us to the most critical component of any cyberspacecraft: the modem. I'll tell you a dirty 
little secret that the folks who sell computers would just as soon I not divulge: Even the weeniest 286 
computer can process data faster than the fastest 28.8K modem. So, given the choice of skimping on the 
computer or skimping on  the modem, skimp on the computer.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=170 HEIGHT=135 SRC="art/callout.gif" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>
  The rule of thumb for the modem is simply this: the faster, the better. There are a few caveats (Latin for 
"watch your ass") to this rule. First, your service provider has to have high-speed lines, or you're wasting 
your money. If you can only dial in at 9600 baud, your transwarp modem is going to twiddle its thumbs a 
lot. Second, if your local phone service is run by Joe and Sara using two soup cans and a string, you are 
wasting your money if you buy a fast modem. Poor quality phone lines force modems to slow down to 
compensate for errors. Third, if you are using an older computer you should probably buy an internal 
modem instead of an external, since the older serial port will be unable to handle high-speed data 
transmissions over 14.4K.
<P>
 Why should you buy an external, instead of an internal, modem, especially when internals are cheaper? 
Because externals are easier to install, don't use an expansion slot, won't conflict with existing serial 
ports, and have really useful lights on the front to help you diagnose communication problems.
	Okay, so what modem should you buy? Any modem you buy should be fully Hayes compatible and 
V.34, V.42bis compliant, and support MNP-5 and LAP-M protocols. Don't worry about what all this 
means (the salesman 
doesn't know either); just make sure it is on the box. As to what brand to buy, I 
personally wouldn't touch anything that 
wasn't made by Hayes or U.S. Robotics. You will find many cheaper modems, but you will get what you 
pay for. Hayes and U.S. Robotics are universally supported by every online service and ISP I have seen, so 
you can't go wrong buying them. Expect to pay $300-400 for these babies, but expect to get your 
money's worth.
The systems I have mentioned are strictly geared toward getting you on the 'net without bankrupting you. 
While a 386- 25 computer does an acceptable job of running Netscape or AOL software, it stinks at 
running WordPerfect for Windows or Windows 95. If you need a "multipurpose" system, then buy one 
of the all-in-one systems I mentioned above. Otherwise, save your money for faster modems and bigger 
hard drives.
