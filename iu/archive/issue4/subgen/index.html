             <B>The image seems to be everywhere these days.</B> The floating, 
disembodied head of a middle-aged man, almost painfully '50s-esque, 
smoking a pipe and smirking at a joke that somehow you just know you 
would never be comfortable if you knew punch line. 
<P>
    That's "Bob." Or, to be formal, Bob Dobbs, the Living Avatar of <B>S</B>lack. 
The icon of the Church of the <B>S</B>ubGenius, a joke that started out with a 
snippet of clip art, a short pamphlet and a couple of guys dubious about the 
value of anything...
<P>
		"What's Bob? He's just the luckiest guy in the whole world. He has all 
the slack and everyone  else has to work for a living. But he's going to 
change all that," says the Rev. Ivan Stang, who works for Bob. Which is 
ironic, since Stang and a friend created him.
"Now, actually, I try to avoid my boss. It's bad enough his picture is everywhere."
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=77 HEIGHT=108 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/bob4.gif" VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10>
	"Bob" is everywhere. Decals, T-shirts, coffee mugs, Web site backgrounds, bumper stickers, ASCII art, 
posters, book jacket covers, bookmarks and home pages. "I've seen it blow up to the size of a mountain 
side," <B>S</B>tang says. He doesn't mind some hapless slackers making use of the icon; he would be bothered if 
the trademark started getting used by some corporate suits to sell products, though.
<P>
	"We're supposed to be making millions of bucks doing this. But of course, no one is really on the 
Web," says <B>S</B>tang.

In the beginning
</B>
</FONT>
<P>
	For the uninitiated, this is the story of "Bob," according to <B>S</B>tang. Back in the 1950s, "Bob" realized 
that there was this conspiracy of normal people robbing away the slack of the abnormals. Of course, 
that's a huge category, the abnormals, says <B>S</B>tang. "It's hard to corral them all behind a single front. Even 
ÎBob' has a hard time with that. By definition, they are all different. Normals can be defined as anyone 
you don't like." 
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=116 HEIGHT=87 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="art/hand.gif" VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10>
	A few common misperceptions about the whole Church of the SubGenius thing:
	"Bob" is not a 
real person, nor was he ever a living, breathing individual (although Stang will contest this vehemently). 
In fact, "Bob" was a piece of clip art destined for Yellow Page ads when <B>S</B>tang and a close friend, Philo 
Drummond, found him in the late 1970s. He just looked like all these guys the pair had seen in 1950s 
advertisements in mainstream mags. They were smug, happy men, who looked as if they learned to fit in 
with a decent-paying job and an easy 1950s post-war mortgage. To Stang and Drummond, the concept of 
a "Bob" represented all that life could be for a man who really didn't like to work too much: nice house, 
soft job, some poor schlep neighbor kid to mow his lawn while he smoked his pipe in the backyard 
hammock and napped.
<P>
	"We knew who Dobbs was before we found the classic picture of him. We started seeing these pipe 
guys in <I>Better Homes and Gardens</I> ads in the '50s. Then we found this piece of clip art. We saw it and we 
both went, "Aha! This must be the one,'" <B>S</B>tang says.
<P>


	The Church of the <B>S</B>ubGenius isn't really a church. It's actually pretty anti-church. It's not a cult. It's a 
state of mind. (Although, so is a cult, but that's a whole other story). The preachings of mass religion 
really pushed them to do it, says Stang.
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=111 HEIGHT=105 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="art/family.gif" VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10>
	"I'm like L. Ron Hubbard, another struggling science-fiction writer," <B>S</B>tang jokes. "I couldn't get 
anything published, so I started a religion" Although, he stresses he didn't do it alone. "Bob" channeled 
his word through a legion of dedicated, often prolific followers in the past two decades.
<P>
	The whole affair started in Dallas, largely in the underground comics world. Stang created these nutty 
pamphlets, selling "Bob" as a religious icon through tales 
of complex negotiations with terrible aliens, ways to save oneself through slack and, of course, requests to 
send money. Unlike most religions, they even offered a guarantee: "Eternal salvation -- or triple your 
money back!"
<P>
	"That's the first place that I was sending them at first. The publishers all looked at this stuff and 
thought, ÎOh, more kook materials,' and would throw them in the trash. But the artists at these places 
would 
pick them out of the trash, read them and think, ÎCool.'"
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=77 HEIGHT=108 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/bob3.gif" VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10>
	Within time, <B>S</B>tang and Drummond got invited to do a radio show. Then another. And another. 
Within a few years, they had enough of a following, so they published their <I>Book of the SubGenius</I>. It's 
never been a best-seller, perhaps hitting 50,000 copies, but it's been the epicenter of any serious liberal 
arts grad student's wood plank-and-cinder block library ever since. Now the Church has a new book, 
<I>Revelation X</I>. <B>S</B>tang said he's not sure how that's selling. His other pamphlet/book <I>High Weirdness by Mail </I>
outlining all the offers by "rival crackpots," as <B>S</B>tang puts it, remains one of the highlights of the Web site, 
new and improved, with hyperlinks. Over the years, they've developed a message. It's pretty simple. It 
was first outlined in pamphlets and later in the books.
<P>
	"What we're really trying to communicate? Send ÎBob' as much money as you possibly can. Don't be 
fooled by lying crackpots and religious nuts that might tell you the same thing. We're the only ones that 
don't lie about how full of bullshit we are and that's worth something," says <B>S</B>tang. "Fuck the normals 
and get all the slack you can. The first rule of the church can be politely termed ÎLet he that cannot take a 
joke, let them mount up upon themselves.'"
<P>

	Along the way, <B>S</B>tang himself  has evolved into something of a cultish figure. How else do you explain 
a 42-year-old in a white suit, "preaching" to the masses before a GWAR concert? That was his most 
recent attempt at missionary work. Stang doesn't have a real job. Well, he used to be a freelance video 
and film producer, traveling all over the world. Now, he just writes and sits at his Dallas home, putting 
together one of the largest, most heavily-linked non-commercial sites on the Web -- the <B>S</B>hrine of the 
<B>S</B>ubGenius.
<P>
	Along with the Web site, <B>S</B>tang travels the country (the details of his itineraries are available on the 
Web site). He hits clubs, offering the Word of "Bob" and along with an accompanying act, the Circus 
Apocalypse, they eat lightbulbs, breathe fire and sew each other's mouths shut with piano wire. And, of 
course, they take up a collection. Most audiences fall in the $300 to $400 range.

	"You never know who will show up, little old ladies and families with kids. Kids with piercings, it's 
not something you can pin down."
<P>
	<B>S</B>ome of the other Church creators have little to do with the Internet activities. Drummond, also 42, 
lives in St. Louis where he heads a popular band, The <B>S</B>winging Love Corpses. Another Church of the 
<B>S</B>ubGenius founder, Paul Mavrites, author of the cartoon The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers, just recently 
won a lawsuit with the state of California over taxes (the <B>S</B>ubGenius Church pleaded with believers to 
send Mavrites money, of course). Over the years, there have been dozens who have added to the 
collective wisdom of the Church's teaching. <B>S</B>tang has served as ring leader, occasionally bringing the 
"prophets" together in a hotel room, turning on a tape recorder and letting the spirit of "Bob" bring forth 
new worship to their icon.

	Throughout the years, <B>S</B>tang and his minions have set up a complex set of hierarchies of Elder Gods, 
holy creatures, essays on the Word of "Bob" and an elaborate foretelling of the future that includes saving 
the human race by way of Flying <B>S</B>aucers. It's a lot of stuff and it really didn't fit together through the 
pamphlets distributed by a small network of <B>S</B>ubGenius workers. Plus, access to other slackers preaching 
the Good Word of "Bob" or the occasional "preaching" sessions offered by Stang and his cronies didn't 
really spread the church's mission statements as far as the founders would have liked. So, for most paper, 
the head of "Bob" and the accompanying word were something of an inside joke for academics, 
intellectuals and the occasional glue-sniffing polymorphic biker.
<P>
	But the technology of the Web allows slackers to get their dose of <B>S</B>ubGenius without leaving the 
comfort of their desks. (And what could be better for a bunch 
of slackers?) 
<P>
	"We finally got on the Internet about a year ago and we found that there was a newsgroup, alt.slack," 
<B>S</B>tang says. His voice is serious. "It was like discovering a new subcontinent. It really was the that big. In 
many ways, it was a blessing. The Church has been around so long that it needed a whole shot in the arm. 
For us, it really is so much cheaper to print on electrons than paper. And we could never handle color."
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=77 HEIGHT=108 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/bob2.gif" VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10>
	Now, the Church of the <B>S</B>ubGenuis site has color. Lots of it. It also has radio, with sermons by <B>S</B>tang 
available for the downloading, featuring church preachers and bands heard in real time via TrueSpeech. 
On his Web site, you can find the Endless FAQ (pity the poor sucker who expected a detailed Frequently 
Asked Questions list for a newsgroup called alt.slack). The Hall of Answers offers a serious look at dogs 
and slacking. You can learn about detailed pacts with terrible aliens or why it's all right to quit your job 
and become a slacker, if only for a couple of minutes. Then there's Bob's <B>S</B>lacktime Funhouse, filled with 
screensavers, games and more (most programs are for Macs). That's just the beginning.
<P> 

	"It's funny how I got this giant Web site. These guys at <B>S</B>unsite approached me and said, ÎDo you 
know anything about the Web?' I said ÎNo' and they said, ÎGood. How  would you like to head up a big 
Web site?' I wrote up this plan that included video and audio. ÎExperts' at the time   kept telling me these 
things were impossible. But even before we finished the text part, audio and video became available."
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=121 HEIGHT=119 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="art/photo2.gif" VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10>
	<B>S</B>tang doesn't get paid for doing the Web site, 
nor does he pay for it. Sunsite, a technology lab,  offers the space on their server free. The Web has 
revolutionized the Church.
<P> 
	"I'm really excited about the various radio formats. We've got the radio show in  TrueSpeech and they 
seem to have all the bugs worked out but now the site is so damn busy I cannot get into it so I can't tell." 
His sermons on the Web have expanded to include the Unclean Hour of <B>S</B>lack, which incorporates foul 
language and naughty jokes he could never use on the air. He wonders how long he'll be able to keep it 
up, as the Web becomes the knot in a tug of war over obscenity issues. "I worry about the censorship 
aspects. That's a real danger. I feel like we're cussing on borrowed time. I started realizing a couple of 
months ago. For years, I've been watering down all this cool material for broadcast because of the FCC, 
which I'm used to. But we don't have to on the Internet. At least, not now."
<P>
	<B>S</B>tang can see a future in which the government dictates the parameters of the Internet the same way 
it's learned to regulate everything from postal codes to airport gridlock in its nanny-state mentality.<P>

	"I feel sorry for those in that position when the hackers decide to get revenge. Just as the Army has 
things stashed away that could wipe out all life on Earth, hackers have stuff stashed away that could shut 
down the government. It could be ugly."

	Of course, the hallmark for the Church of the <B>S</B>ubGenius lies within the standard concept that no one 
should really trust anything but themselves. Never rely on the word of someone in a suit, offering a 
simple solution or with a methodology that screams hidden agenda. To Stang, most organized religions 
fall within those parameters. Yet, without 'em, the <B>S</B>ubGenius clan wouldn't exist. 
<P>
	"Real religions wouldn't like us much if they knew that we were making fun of them, but few do. The 
New Age people get upset, though. They think we're putting out all this negative energy," says Stang. "It 
would be really easy to pull a David Koresh, though. People will pay to find out what they believe. They 
don't know any better, so they will hold on fiercely to their cherished beliefs. People don't distrust 
religion enough. They'll sure distrust it if they become a follower of ÎBob' for very long. The way it's set 
up, it's very attractive and you're going to get all this slack and ÎBob' promises all these wonderful things. 
Maybe there's more than a joke. There are probably people who believe Î"Bob" is going to save me.' And 
then we pull the rug out from under them. We deprogram our own zombies." 
<P>

	In the end, those who want to be really safe should probably purchase their escape vessel tickets, $30 
from the Church(no tickets will be sold on the saucers.)
<P>
	"Everyone thinks we're joking about that one. 
But hey, one of these religions has to be real. What if 
it's this one?"
