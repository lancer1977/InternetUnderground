<B>Alcoholics Anonymous was started many years ago</B> with one basic philosophy: The people in the best position to 
help alcoholics are other alcoholics.  
<P>
	This was a pretty radical concept in its day, one that some critics viewed as allowing a fox to guard the chicken 
coop. If that wasn't tricky enough, AA was also one of the first organizations to use group therapy, treating people 
in a group setting instead of one-on-one.
<P>
	Over the years AA and group therapy have proven effective both therapeutically and -- just as important --  
financially. While a single session with a therapist can cost a patient $75-100, a group session usually costs $35 or 
less per participant. 		 	Group therapy also has one other advantage over individual 
treatment: The patient gets to talk to other patients who have the same problem. Whereas a therapist may only be 
able to sympathize with a rape victim, having never been in a similar position, other rape victims can empathize 
with each other.

	  Group therapy, at its simplest, is just people talking to each other under the supervision of a therapist. People 
tell their stories and discuss their concerns, their fears, their anger and their desires, while receiving feedback from 
the group. This simple structure is what has made the concept of group therapy easily adaptable to the modern 
world of the Usenet. After all, what is the Usenet except an exceptionally large forum in which people express their 
concerns, fears, anger and desires while receiving feedback. Thus were born the <A HREF="12side.htm">alt.support.* discussion groups</A>.

<B>The Usenet support groups</B> cover a wide range of personal, social and medical 
problems, from divorce to depression. Medical problems such as prostate cancer, multiple sclerosis and kidney failure 
are actively discussed not just by people suffering from these conditions, but 
also researchers studying or treating the same problems.
<P>

	When  BetaSeron (beta-interferon 1B) was approved for  the treatment of multiple sclerosis, many MS patients 
turned to alt.support.multiple-sclerosis to learn the benefits and side-effects of taking the drug. Early adopters of 
the treatment explained the rather involved procedure for preparing  and injecting the drug, receiving advice from 
diabetics about overcoming people's natural disinclination to be a pin cushion. With this kind of information 
available, MS patients on the 'net could make much more informed decisions about whether to try the drug -- an 
important decision, given the drug's $1000 a month price tag.
<P>
	In the alt.support.disabled.sexuality group, people discuss a topic which most of the able-bodied public would 
like to ignore: the sexual needs of the physically disabled. This group meets a crucial need that would be extremely 
difficult to accommodate outside of cyberspace. Sex, all snickering aside, is a pretty embarrassing subject to discuss 
in a group setting. Add to this the difficulty of arranging a meeting of people whose mobility is greatly limited, and 
a general public to whom the disabled are sexless creatures, and you get a discussion group that could only exist on 
the Internet.
<P>
	Victims of sexual abuse find advice, understanding and support from fellow survivors. Substance abusers may 
find strength and support in the tradition of real-life AA groups. Dieters find sympathy and wry humor from other 
folks faced with the endless daily battle with food and flagging self-esteem.
<P>

	Though the alt.support groups are rich sources of information, and can be a great comfort to people 
participating in the discussions, they are not without problems. Unmoderated groups still have to deal with flames, 
trolls and spams like everybody else, and some of these people's tactics can take on a decidedly cruel  edge. In the 
medical groups, arguments  break out periodically over treatment options and medical advice. In the groups dealing 
with topics like depression, sexual abuse and alcoholism, the air can become thick with the judgmental remarks of 
self-styled psychologists. If it is possible to imagine, an even thicker hide and greater degree of skepticism may be 
called for to participate in these discussions than is normally needed on the 'net newsgroups.
	Ultimately, it all boils down to personal judgment. People have to decide who to trust, who to listen t, and who 
to ignore.

<B>I spoke to more than 30 individuals</B> from numerous support groups about their feelings on the medium. Why did 
they participate? How often? What did they like about the groups?
<P>

	A very informal survey of the people I spoke with showed that the majority (about 60 percent) were females in 
their late 30s or early 40s. As to why people participate, the answer was almost always the same: it's easy and 
cheap. 
<P>	

	Julie, a regular on the MS group, came straight to the point. "I can participate from home. I can choose when to 
participate. I don't have to get dressed or fight traffic. I can choose which participants I want to talk to, and which 
ones to avoid."
<P>
	J.D., a moderator for the soc.support.loneliness group concurred, "It's accessible 24-hours-a-day, doesn't cost 
$60 an hour and you get what you pay for. Seriously, it's a lot like the AA and Narcotics Anonymous groups -- the 
benefit of one lonely person helping another is without parallel."
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=154 HEIGHT=231 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/photo2.gif" VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10>	
	Most folks check in on their group once a day, some people several times a day. This is especially true of folks 
from alt.support.diet, who find that checking several times a day helps them avoid temptation and depression.
<P>
	Another major plus for on-
line support may lie in the built-in anonymity of the 'net. Nobody can see you, or really knows who you are unless 
you tell them.
<P>
	"There is more honesty when people can be anonymous and not be held accountable for what they say," explains 
Jessica, who has been participating in her group for six months. This, of course, is also a disadvantage.
<P>
	"There are a lot of cretins on the 'net", J.D. says. "(and these) folks forced myself and my associates to found a 
moderated newsgroup."
<P>
	On the subject of whether the groups should be moderated, folks seem to be evenly divided.
	"Spammers exist in everyday life," comments Kevin, a regular on the AA group. "So it's no big deal."
		Jessica seems a bit more concerned. "I have never participated in a moderated group, [but] it does seem like 
having a moderator would get rid of some of the flames, sales pitches and off-topic posts.

<P>

<B>Therein falls one of the major complaints</B> about virtual support, one that echoes throughout the 'net. Namely, 
spammers and flammers.<P>
	 "Nuts all over. You have to lose time reading, ëtil you notice they're nuts," notes Jacob from the MSnewsgroup. 
<P>
	Ironically, the other complaint is the lack of face-to-face contact.
<P>
	"It just isn't the same as sitting with real people," explains Pam, another AA participant. "People still need 
contact."
<P>
	"No hugs," agrees Jessica. "No getting together for coffee afterward."

	<B>Even if you pride yourself on being</B> a well-adjusted individual who doesn't need any kind of help (which may 
show you have a high capacity for self-delusion), the alt.support.* hierarchy is a fascinating place to visit. Not for 
any 
of the grotesque, voyeuristic reasons 
routinely associated with daytime talk shows, but for the simple opportunity of gaining insight into human foibles 
and virtues. The silly arguments, tragic mistakes and poor judgment you read about are more than counterbalanced 
by insightful observation, noble sacrifices and sound advice.
<P>
	On a Usenet too often filled with the self-centered rants of hucksters and hate-mongers, it's nice to find the 
voices of  people quietly, yet determinedly looking out for each other. It is good to know that a helping hand is only 
keystrokes away.
