As I sit down to write this story, I look around my desk and think, "Isn't it ironic that I'm writing a story about organized 
browsing." Bad Alanis Morissette 
references aside, (memo to myself: stop listening to the so-called alternative radio station) I don't just need programs that 
help me organize Web sites I've been to; I wish someone would develop something to help me organize my cluttered desk.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The newest bookmarking programs -- for lack of a better catch-all, that's what I'll refer to them as -- offer many neat bells 
and whistles from offline browsing to Web site monitoring. Even though finding info that you once saw on the Web is relatively 
easy by doing a search with Yahoo!, Lycos or AltaVista, it's most satisfying to have a storehouse of your favorite picks close at 
hand. 
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For purposes of this story, I picked six of the more interesting bookmarking programs available today. Most browsers do 
have built-in bookmarking applications, but the programs reviewed here are exciting additions due to their pure focus on 
actually enhancing your organizational skills.

It's amazing how lazy I can be when I surf sometimes. The very act of bookmarking a site seems a monumental effort. If 
you sympathize, you'll love the <A HREF="break.htm#zoo"><B>ZooWorks Personal Edition</B></A>, Hitachi's new effort at taming the jungle of cyberspace. 
ZooWorks works within your browser as a search engine. All you need to remember is a vague detail of any site you've ever 
visited and ZooWorks will pull it up. You can search by keyword or date. You can also organize URLs into folders so you won't 
have to search your entire database each time you want to find popular sites. Another file management technique also allows 
you to label sites "confidential" so your boss or spouse won't be able to follow your virtual footsteps.

<A NAME="indho"> </A>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<A HREF="break.htm#hot"><B>HotPage</B></A> from DocuMagix operates like a file cabinet built into your browser. Considering my ineptitude at filing, the deck 
was loaded against HotPage. A major asset of the program is its installation of 
a command right into your Netscape toolbar that allows  users to simply drag down a menu for immediate filing of a URL. 
From the menu you can also "HotPrint" a Web page, essentially making a virtual hard copy of the page that you can later read 
while offline. If you're not in the mood to file the instant you save a page, URLs go into an "In Box" (just like the cluttered 
ones on my desk) for future filing. Another feature allows you to combine HotPrinted pages with live links to other Windows 
documents created with Word or Excel. While HotPage may work well if you're organized in the real world, I found it 
cumbersome;  all too soon the virtual file 
cabinets and In Box became hopelessly cluttered up.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Like the TV show of the same name that some lame brain at Nick at Nite pulled from the schedule this year, <A HREF="break.htm#drag"><B>Dragnet</B></A> from OnBase is solid, workmanlike and no-nonsense. This is bookmarking at its very best, simplistic cataloging and 
categorizing of one's favorite Web sites. While it may not live up to the hyperbolic subtitle "the Ultimate Net Address Book," 
Dragnet is easy to use from the get-go, employing a simple drag-and-drop interface not unlike the original and oft-copied Mac 
OS. Other features included are a search feature for your bookmarks and the ability to make hotlist windows for your favorite 
URLs. The only drawback is that the product is not fully integrated with your browser, meaning extra mouse clicks between 
programs.

<A NAME="indw"> </A>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As faithful as good ol' Rover, DataViz's <A HREF="break.htm#web"><B>WebBuddy</B></A> aims to be your browser's "best friend." If you have a 
big monitor, you'll love WebBuddy's easy access toolbar, which makes bookmarking a breeze. For smaller monitors, you can 
choose to use WebBuddy Central, just a separate program that results in more mouse clicks. Beyond the  straightforward 
bookmarking function, WebBuddy offers some interesting features. Rather than fetching your pipe, slippers and the evening 
paper, WebBuddy has the ability to retrieve pages and sites for offline browsing. You can even schedule the program to 
download sites at off-peak times. Additionally, WebBuddy allows you to convert Web pages 
into Word documents. While WebBuddy was definitely not 
a "dog" of a program, at times it was ploddingly slow -- but that may have been more 
a result of its beta status than anything else.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The granddaddy of all bookmarking programs, however, is <A HREF="break.htm#smart"><B>SmartBookmarks</B></A> from FirstFloor. SmartBook
marks 2.0 starts with the 
simple bookmarking premise familiar to those users of 
the FirstFloor's Smartmarks plug-in for Netscape. In the latest version, a bunch of new features makes it simply the best 
program for organizing your browsing. For instance, you can now choose to monitor sites with "agents" that will check URLs at 
a pre-determined time (say start-up) to see if any new info has been added to the pages. I use the agents to see if there's 
any new news at  the Camp Nebagamon or <I>Michigan Daily</I> alumni sites. The agents also  can retrieve the sites they check for 
offline browsing. Another great innovation is a built-in search feature that allows you to choose numerous directories to comb 
the Web. These searches can be saved in the program, allowing you to run them again and again to see if Yahoo! has added 
any new <I>X-Files</I> sites. On top of it all, SmartBookmarks is fully integrated with Netscape's and Microsoft's browsers, making it 
the easiest to use of all the products tested. 
<BR>
<A NAME="indhi"> </A>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<A HREF="break.htm#hind"><B>Hindsite</B></A>, so the saying goes, is 20/20, and that's the premise of ISYS's entry to the bookmarking market. The program 
works on the same premise as Zooworks by keeping a searchable record of every site you've visited. The query feature of the 
search is quite advanced with "and," "or" and "but not" options. For non-Booleans, there's a plain English search option. One 
shortcoming of Hindsite is that you have to manually update the index of sites you've visited. While you only have to press a 
button to do so, it's an extra step nonetheless.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nobody likes a smarty pants, yet 
it's hard to resist Grasp Information Corporation's <A HREF="break.htm#know"><B>Know-It-All</B></A>. While the name may imply omniscience, the program can only 
know as much as the user. So say you were browsing the Web, collecting Mentos information. Rather than bookmark all of 
the Mentos sites you've come to, Know-It-All lets you grab specific snippets from the sites. All you have to do is highlight the 
passage you want to save and click on the category where you want to save it on the toolbar. If, when going through these 
snippets, that are on pages in the program like little Post-It Notes,  you want to revisit a site, you just use the "source link" 
option. Know-It-All also allows you to grab snippets from any other source such as e-mail or 
newsgroup postings. You can also edit 
snippets and use them to create new documents. While the program has a high "gee-whiz factor," in terms of overall 
usefulness, cutting and pasting seems 
a lot simpler. 
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After testing all six programs, I've chosen to continue using SmartBook-marks with ZooKeeper. I'll also keep Hindsite as a 
back-up. However, I encourage you to download the programs' free test betas and try them for yourself, since each program is 
based on a different model, and will speak to 
different peoples' strengths. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to dig out a missing invoice from my desk.
