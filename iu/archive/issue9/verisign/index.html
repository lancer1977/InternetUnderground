Remember that <I>New Yorker</I> cartoon with the two canines sitting behind a 
computer terminal -- "On the Internet, nobody knows that you're a dog?" Well, that 
sort of magical anonymity the Internet offers is increasingly a problem for business 
interests that are trying to commercialize the Information Superhighway.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Think about it. Although anonymity might be nice for a few college pranksters or a 
whistle-blower trying to file a complaint with the OSHA, most people using the 
Internet like to know the identity of the person or organization with which they are 
communicating. If you are trying to do business on the Internet, a person's name 
isn't just something that's nice to have -- it is an essential ingredient if you need to 
enforce the provisions of a contract.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For more than a year, Web sites using the Netscape "secure" Commerce Server 
have had a digital ID nailed to their door. The ID contains the name of the company 
with which you are doing business, and is digitally signed so that it can't be forged. 
Originally developed by RSA Data Security, the 
electronic ID card business was spun off in May 1995 to a Silicon Valley start-up 
named VeriSign. Other funding for VeriSign came from VISA International, Mitsubishi 
and big names in the computer security field like Fischer International.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
VeriSign's Server Certificates, as the Web IDs are called, are a good gig. The IDs 
cost $295 each, are sold directly by the company over the Internet and need to be 
renewed every year for $99. But VeriSign wants more: Now it is out to make its 
trademarked "Digital ID" the driver's license of cyberspace. Just like a bar carding 
you to check your age, or a car rental firm checking your ID to get your permanent 
address, VeriSign hopes that cybermalls and shops will soon be asking you to 
present your Digital ID when you step into their electronic establishments.

We're VeriSign: Trust Us

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you have ever used Netscape Navigator, then you have a relationship of electronic 
trust with VeriSign. That's because VeriSign's public key is built into 
every copy of Navigator that's ever been shipped. 
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Netscape Communications used to brag about this fact. The implication was that 
having a single key somehow added a level of security and assurance to doing 
business on the Internet. The idea was that if you were looking at a "secure" Web 
site -- that is, if you were using Netscape's proprietary encryption system to 
exchange secret information over the Internet -- and you wanted to verify the 
authenticity of the organization with which you were communicating, you could 
simply select the menu "View Document Info."
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Try it right now. Go to the URL <A HREF="https://www.vineyard.net/">www.vineyard.net/</A> and pick View Document 
Info. You'll probably see the message, "This is a secure document that uses a 
medium-grade encryption key suited for US export (RC4-Export, 128 bit with 40 
secret)." You'll also notice that the document is signed with a certificate belonging 
to Vineyard.NET, Inc., Vineyard Haven, Mass., US (the Web site in my basement). 
Look further, and you'll notice that the certificate was issued by the Secure Data Server Certificate Authority, RSA Data Security, Inc., U.S. That's because in mid-
May, I paid VeriSign $295 on my credit card and bought myself a Web server 
certificate.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hey, wait a second! What's going on? If I bought the certificate from VeriSign, 
how come 
it has RSA Data Security's name on it?
<BR>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=236 SRC="botty.gif" VSPACE=20 HSPACE=20>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I posed this question to Stratton Sclavos, VeriSign's president & CEO. It's an 
important question, because under VeriSign's own policies, when a company 
changes its name, its certificates are supposed to be automatically revoked and the 
company is forced to get new certificates under its new operating name. Why then, I 
asked Sclavos, is VeriSign appearing to break its own rule, and use a key that 
belongs to another organization?
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"The RSA Secure Server is what we issue our certificates under," he said. "The 
future versions of the Navigator that are in beta right now will include VeriSign CA 
(certificate authority) roots."
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Apparently, there are simply so many copies of Netscape Navigator 1.0 and 2.0 
on the Internet right now, that it would be impractical for VeriSign to start issuing 
certificates under a new key or a new name. If they change their master key, all of 
those millions of copies of Netscape Navigator won't be able to go into secure 
cryptographic mode.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This dilemma neatly illustrates the single biggest complaint that's been levied 
against VeriSign to date: The company was created to be a monopoly for Internet 
identification, and it has largely been acting as one -- making up its own rules, 
expecting others to abide by them and then breaking its rules when it sees fit.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Over the past year, there have been persistent rumors that VeriSign has been a 
difficult company to do business with -- to put it mildly. Privately, companies have 
said that VeriSign has been slow to renew keys for the Netscape Commerce Server 
(which, remember, expires every year). Another rumor is that the company has 
asked for more than the publicly stated $99 renewal fee. But in every case, critics 
have been unwilling to speak on the record to the press. Why? Possibly, because 
VeriSign holds the master key. If VeriSign doesn't renew a 
company's certificate, then that company's secure Web server stops working. 
Circumstances like these put VeriSign in a very powerful bargaining position.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
But with the advent of Netscape's Navigator 3.0, the VeriSign monopoly has been 
broken. Unlike previous versions of Navigator, which only supported 
a single Certificate Authority,  Navigator 3.0 allows you to have as many CAs as you 
wish. The program comes out of the box 
with several different master certificates embedded inside it: AT&T Research, AT&T, 
RSA Secure Server, CommerceNet, MCI 
Mall, Netscape Test, RSA Commercial and two keys for VeriSign.

The Digital ID That Doesn't
</B></FONT>
<P>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The real hoopla for the second half of this year isn't going to be certificates for 
Web servers and organizations, but for users. It's these certificates that VeriSign is 
calling its Digital IDs.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To create a Digital ID, all 
you need to do is click into <A HREF="http://digitalid.verisign.com/">VeriSign's Digital ID Center</A>. 
After you answer a few questions and click on some of the 
links, a special (and undocumented) piece of HTML will be downloaded into your 
copy of Netscape Navigator 3.0 that will cause your program's cryptographic wheels 
to start spinning. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From the outside, it will look like your copy of Navigator has crashed. But what's 
really happening is that it's searching for 100-digit prime numbers that will be used 
to create your secret and public key. Once these keys are created, the secret key is 
stored in a file on your hard disk -- optionally encrypted with a pass phrase of your 
choice. The public key is both stored on your hard disk and a copy is sent to 
VeriSign's master computer where 
it is signed by VeriSign's secret 
key and sent back to you. Congratulations, you now have a Digital ID.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If a Web site wants you to "sign your name" with your Digital ID, your browser 
should pop up a window and show you a list of certificates that you can send. What 
happens next is kind of interesting. The Web site sends you a random number. Your 
Web browser signs this number with your secret key. Your browser then sends the 
signed number, your public key and your Digital ID certificate to the Web site. At the 
other end of the connection, the Web site verifies your signature on the random 
number with your public key and then it verifies VeriSign's signature on your Digital 
ID. Finally, it checks to make sure that the public key you provided is the same as 
the public key on the Digital ID. If all of these checks pass, then you must be you.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The point to having Digital IDs is that they're supposed to be much more secure, 
more flexible and more powerful than the usernames and passwords that many Web 
sites, from HotWired to The New York Times, are using for identification. Here are 
some of the stated advantages:
<P>
<UL>

<LI>Instead of having a different password (and possibly username) for each site, 
you need only one Digital ID. If you decide to protect your secret key with a 
password, you get the same password with every Web site and that password never 
travels over the Internet.
<P>
<LI>Since your Digital ID carries your e-mail address, you don't have to type it in. 
Even better, the Web site doesn't have to e-mail you a username and password to 
the e-mail address you provide 
in order to establish that it's 
legitimate.
<P>
<LI>Because your public key is a real RSA cryptographic public key, people can use 
it to send you encrypted e-mail over the Internet. Indeed, support for encrypted 
e-mail is planned for future versions of Netscape Navigator.
<P>
</UL>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As part of the publicity campaign to hype its Digital IDs, VeriSign gave out its first 
to 
Marc Andreessen, author of the 
original Mosaic program, co-founder of Netscape and currently Netscape's vice 
president of 
technology.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Search through VeriSign's Web site (or simply jump to <A HREF="http://www.verisign.com/pr/pr_qnama.htm">
http://digitalid.verisign.com/</A> 
and you'll find a spiffy 
question-and-answer session with Andreessen, including the boy-wonder's pouting 
photograph and the proud legend, "DIGITAL ID HOLDER NUMBER: 1."<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The only problem with Andreessen's Digital ID is that  VeriSign's Digital ID really 
isn't an ID, in that it doesn't identify Andreessen in any conventional sense of the 
word. Andreessen's photograph is on the VeriSign 
Q&A and it's on his California 
state driver's license, but his 
photograph does not appear on his VeriSign Digital ID.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"My Digital ID proves that I am Marc Andreessen as I communicate with others 
and navigate over the Internet," says Andreessen. Except it doesn't. All that his 
Digital ID proves is that he happens to have the matching secret key that goes with 
a public key on file at VeriSign. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Indeed, Andreessen's Digital ID doesn't even prove that he 
is a human being. That's because it's a Class 1 Digital ID, which VeriSign hands out 
for free to 
anybody with an e-mail address. You could, for example, write 
a computer program that goes to VeriSign's Web site and obtains hundreds of 
Digital IDs, each 
one for a slightly different e-mail address. All Andreessen's Digital ID proves is that 
he could 
have, at some point in the past, received e-mail at the address 
marca@netscape.com.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"I can automatically identify myself when I visit secure sites without having to 
remember my different username and password combinations," says Andreessen. 
True enough. In fact, with his Digital ID buried inside his copy of Netscape 
Navigator, Andreessen can now automatically provide his e-mail address to any Web 
site that he visits. He probably knows that, when he clicks on the Navigator button 
to send his Digital ID, but will your mother?<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It gets even more interesting if you search VeriSign's "Digital ID Center" for Marc 
Andreessen's name. I tried it, and I didn't find just one single Digital ID: I found five 
of them, for the e-mail addresses marca@netscape.com, Marca@netscape.com, 
marca@ Netscape.com, MarkA@netscape. com and MarkA@Netscape.com.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
How's that for positive identification? "On the Internet, 
nobody knows if you are Marc Andreessen."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
VeriSign probably realizes that a Class 1 Digital ID isn't worth the virtual paper 
that it's written 
on -- that's why the company is giving them away free for non-
commercial use. For VeriSign, 
the real action is going to be at 
the higher certification levels -- Classes 2, 3 and 4.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To get a Class 2 Digital ID, VeriSign will require that your identification be verified 
by Equifax, one of the nation's big three 
credit reporting agencies. Class 3 IDs will require a notarized affidavit. And the 
company still hasn't made public the conditions for getting one of its Class 4 IDs -- 
"contact VeriSign" is what the company's Web site says.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It turns out that other people aren't exactly comfortable with this new world of 
digital identification that VeriSign is promulgating. Take Carl Ellison, a senior 
systems engineer at CyberCash, who has spent much of his professional life thinking 
about the issue of public key cryptography.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The main problem with VeriSign's approach to identification, says Ellison, is that 
different people have different needs for identity, and therefore have different 
notions of what proper 
identification is. "Some people mean a name. Some people mean a human body. 
Some people mean that guy I met long ago. Some people mean any person who 
can be tracked down and 
punished, in case of default of a contract."<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For example, if you are sending e-mail messages to your lover, you don't really 
care if that person's legal name is Juliet Capulet or Julie Capulet. All you care about 
is that your e-mail is only going to be read by her, by nobody else, and that when 
she sends you a letter in return that is signed, it really came from her and from 
nobody else.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Likewise, says Ellison, if you're a shipping clerk looking at a signed purchase 
order, you really don't care whose 
signature is on the form, or who pulled the crank of the 
signature machine. All you care about is that the company whose name is at the top 
of the purchase order will honor its promise to pay your company.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fundamentally, there's no good reason why lovers and companies won't eschew 
VeriSign and simply sign each others' keys. Indeed, that's what Xcert Software is 
hoping  users will do. The Canadian firm has developed its own software suite that 
mimics what VeriSign's does. The difference is that, instead of 
selling certification services, Xcert is actually selling the 
software.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Our model is very different than VeriSign's," says Diana Costain, the company's 
vice president of finance. "We allow anyone to have their own CA. For example, if I, 
as a person, am dealing with my local corner grocery store, I don't want them to 
have all of that information about me -- my social insurance number, credit card 
number, [whether or not] I have a criminal record -- just so I can buy a pack of 
gum."<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Instead, says Costain, companies using the Xcert software will certify their own 
customers -- at least to the best of their own abilities.
