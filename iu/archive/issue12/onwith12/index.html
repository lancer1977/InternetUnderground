You either love them or you've never heard of them. They have 
pioneered the art of sound appropriation and "recontextualizing" for 
the purpose of creating unique audio collages. In 1988, they 
managed to tour the world without leaving home via a device of their 
own creation that allowed them to transmit live broadcasts over 
phone lines, dubbing it their Teletour.

Even though Negativland has been around for nearly two decades, 
it wasn't until 1991 that they garnered any mainstream attention. That 
year the band released their "U2" single, a wicked parody of the 
blarney band's song, "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" 
mixed with sound clips of a cursin' Casey Kasem. What followed was 
a flurry of legal attention from Island Records, U2's label, and 
sporadic reporting of the facts by the music and pop-culture press. 
Negativland went on to document their legal and financial woes in an 
independent zine and CD called <I>The Letter 
U And The Numeral 2</I>. This resulted in a lawsuit by Gregg 
Ginn, owner of SST records, Negativland's then-record label. The 
entire story can and should be read in all its brutal, hilarious and 
outrageous detail in the book <I>Fair Use: The Story Of The Letter U 
And The Numeral 2</I>, which also includes a bonus CD with a 
prime example of Negativland's craftwork.

Today, the sonic outlaws continue their struggle against mediocrity 
and the oppressively outdated U.S. copyright laws at 
NegativWorldWide-WebLand (<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/id/negativland/">http://sunsite.unc.edu/id/negativland/</A>).
 There, users can find 
a Negativland discography and ordering information as well 
as links to sites regarding 
copyright law and free legal representation for artists. 
IU recently caught up with Negativland's Mark Hosler to discuss the 
band's and his opinions of the Internet, intellectual property laws and 
computer frustrations.

Well, you know, we were just down in Los Angeles--we were 
artists in residence at a summer school for the arts for high school 
students. ...There was a classroom where they were learning about 
how to do digital imaging and learning about the Internet and 
basically the assignment was that they were supposed to put 
together some kind of a visual collage based on images that they 
could grab from the Internet. What they were making was kind of an 
original piece of collage art but it was made entirely from snips, you 
know, snipped little chunks and manipulated images of things that 
they grabbed from Web sites all over the world. It was sort of jaw-
dropping to me because I'm 34 years old and I'm thinking, ÎHere's 
this 15-year-old kid and this is how he's being introduced to this 
technology.' You can find all this stuff, but you can just go grab 
anything you want and you can do anything you want with it. This 
was a very interesting thing--this was a state-funded school and they 
were letting Negativland come in. ...I told them before we went down, 
I said, 'You realize that what we're going to tell your students are 
things that are 
on the questionable side of the law.' 
It isn't necessarily even legal what we're telling kids to do...and they 
were all for it. 

<P>

And it's just out there and it's just this totally plastic, infinitely 
reusable, recopiable, new medium. You can do anything you want 
with it. And I thought, that is part of how this kid is getting his 
worldview, his sort of technological and aesthetic worldview is being 
formed by this. Now when I was that age we didn't have that. What 
does this mean when thousands and thousands and thousands of 
these kids grow up and this is what they grew up with as normal? 
And it doesn't matter what the laws say. I don't care, regardless of 
what the laws tell you, you can do this--the technology allows you to 
do this. When you have all these links to other people's sites you can 
be grabbing information from some site to use on your site because 
it's appropriate, because it supports something you're talking about. 
Or you can link to something else and there is a way in which it is 
kind of this giant sort of collage you're making.

Do you have any impressions of how the Internet is going to 
impact U.S. copyright laws?

<P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial, helvetica"><B>

It seems to me that it is certainly prompting multinational, 
corporate-cultural producers to swoop down and try to make sure 
that they can keep the Internet working the way they're used to the 
copyright laws working for the last 100 years. I know there's been 
some white papers circulating around D.C.

I followed [the link at your

That stuff is like, 'Oh my God! Are these people insane? What 
are they thinking?' I think what they want to do is they want to make 
the [Service Provider] liable for any infringement that happens on 
their servers, which means that the only service providers that can 
afford to stay in business would be the ones that can take 
the risk. They'd also end up having these really stringent and 
draconian laws to scare the hell out of all of their users. Then you'd 
have only the big people, only America Online would 
be able to be out there...the little guys would dry up.

<P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial, helvetica"><B>IU:
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica"><BR>
Just the people with 
corporate backing?

<P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial, helvetica"><B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MH:
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica"><BR>
Yeah. Of course what we hopefully all know is that the biggest 
service providers, they have all kinds of censoring limitations on what 
you can and cannot talk about. I've talked to people who've tried 
really hard to find all that horrible pornography [on the Net]...all 
they've ever been able to come up with was a bunch of stuff from 
Playboy magazine. 

<P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica"><BR>My most recent [Negativland] purchase was <I>Over The Edge, 
Vol. 2: Pastor Dick: Muriel's Purse Fund</I> and I thought it had a 
hilarious satire of the Jack Chick religious tracts.

</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial, helvetica"><B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MH:

Yes, we worked very hard on that!

<P>


</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial, helvetica"><B>IU:
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica"><BR>I loved that! Have you considered doing a spoof Web site along 
those lines?

There's a lot of things we've talked about doing on the Internet 
but the problem is we have no resources. All we have are volunteers 
and when you have volunteers it's always hard to get them to do 
anything because everyone does it in their spare time. If we had a 
bunch of money, if everyone who read about the Negativland 
<I>vs</I>. U2 lawsuit actually bought one of our records then maybe 
we could do something. We don't have the money to throw at things 
like that so we put our energy and time into things that we think we 
can at least break even on, like putting out a CD. We have sat 
around and talked about lots of different ideas like that and talked 
about software programs we would like to have written to do different 
things on our site. But trying to get somebody to do it, to take the 
time, it's like a full-time job. I could imagine another type of group 
(there probably already are some out there) but I could imagine 
another type of band where one member of the band, his thing is 
he's the Internet guy. He oversees the whole Internet thing.

Which of the members of Negativland have an interest in or 
knowledge of the Internet?

I guess really, me and Chris (Grigg) and Don (Joyce) probably 
more than anybody. I mean, Idon't even have a way to look at Web 
sites on my own computer. I didn't even get 
e-mail until less than a year ago. My feeling was anything that's this 
hyped I just have an automatic aversion to. I'm being hyped and told 
by everyone around me and all the media that you gotta have this 
thing and immediately my contrariness comes up. I don't want that. I 
have more than enough things to deal with just dealing with the mail 
in my mailbox and my answering machine and trying to do 
Negativland and run our record label. I just said, ÎGreat, that's just 
what I need is hundreds of more messages and ways for people to 
get to me.'

<P>


</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial, helvetica"><B>IU:
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica"><BR>Now that you have e-mail or now that Negativland in general has 
e-mail, what kind of responses have you gotten to your Web site?

Oh, well the Web site's been up for a while. We have this 
because the good folks at Sunsite at the University of North Carolina 
donated the space to us. There is no way in hell Negativland could 
afford the computers, the disk space, all that stuff to have our own 
site--there's no way it could happen. We worked at kind of 
architecting what the site would be like and one of the reasons we 
were given the site was that the folks there felt that ÎHere, let's hand 
Negativland this new medium to work in and given the way that 
Negativland's brains work, they'll probably come up, over time, with 
some kooky, 
interesting, fun things to do with it...'

<P>


</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial, helvetica"><B>IU:
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica"><BR>
Your site definitely seems to be one of the cleanest and it gets 
right to the point--there doesn't seem to be a lot 
of fluff.

We've had lots of compliments on the site and to be honest, I 
don't think we have a particularly great site. I think all it means is that 
most sites are so shitty. ...It's just my feeling about computers in 
general that computers are a <I>tool</I>wever, the way computers 
are sold to the American public through all of those magazines, 
probably like yours and <I>Wired</I>, and through all of those 
companies that make all the computers, is that it is sort of sold like 
it's <I>the tool</I>. It's <I>the thing</I>, it's the thing you gotta have 
and it's not. It's just a tool. So since I got e-mail, I've been sort of 
taking it very slowly. I just want it to be this little thing I have that I 
can use, that's useful for certain types of communication. I have a 
Mac SE. It's about nine years old. I was amazed at how difficult it 
was to get on the Internet. 
It was just unbelievably stupid and cumbersome and ridiculous. I 
couldn't make anything work on the computer that I have because it 
was too old. I was running into the fact that the computer industry is 
the ultimate in planned obsolescence because it's just constantly out-
moding itself every six months to the point where, gee, I can't even 
get on the Internet with this Mac SE because I can't get my Internet 
starter kit software to even read inside my computer because it's the 
wrong size disk drive...

Technology is definitely not kind to people who haven't kept 
current.

Which again, is this kind of economic, exclusionary thing. 
Nowadays, people do ask me advice sometimes about computers 
because they seem to think Negativland is somehow really techno-
savvy. And I'll say, if you want to do some kind of sound-editing stuff 
or some graphics, look for a used Mac IIci. You can get them for like 
$1,000 and they're just fantastic. They're totally great. They'll do 
everything you want; just get something old and don't worry about 
the new thing.

<P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial, helvetica"><B>IU:
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica"><BR>
With advances in broadcast technology on the Internet, do you 
think that Negativland will start distributing recordings over the Web?

<P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial, helvetica"><B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MH:

Well I find that currently, there is a lot of hype and brouhaha 
over the RealAudio stuff and I think it's a very nice idea but, again, it 
is all just a total bunch of shit! It is a bunch of bullshit, it is all hype! 
Basically, I worked very hard with my friends to make these amazing-
sounding stereo recordings in full fidelity and to have it come over 
in mono and sounding like a good 
AM radio is not my idea of a good way...it's interesting but it's not my 
ideal way, not by a longshot. On the other hand, if I was taking 
something where I intended it, from the beginning, from the very get-
go, you create the work so that part of the aesthetic is that it has this 
certain limited, lo-fi sound quality, then that's different. We do have 
this serialized novel that we're going to be putting up in the next 
couple of months, a chapter a month, on our site and there will be 
these buttons you can push to get RealAudio out of some sounds 
that go with it. We know that they're not going to sound perfect, but 
we sort of know that going in.

Which brings us back around to the whole thing about staying 
ahead of the curve and having the latest version of the software.

I have no interest in staying ahead of any curve in terms of 
technology. I have an interest in staying "ahead" of ideas. What 
Negativland has always been interested in and excited by is the idea-
-the cool idea, the weird, confusing, strange, perhaps subversive 
idea. That's what we're really concerned about. I'm also trying to 
reconcile myself to the fact that I grew up in a certain era and there 
are certain things I understand better. I have a certain way of working 
where I can work pretty fast in the studio using a certain level of 
technology, but if you suddenly tell me to start running an automated 
mix-down software program, I'm going to get all mixed up. I'm not 
going to get anything done. Right now, our studio is made up of 
separate components but it's obvious that what's starting to happen 
now and will increasingly happen, is you're going to have something 
that's going to be a recording unit, a mixer, a mix-down thing and 
your effects all in one box.

<P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial, helvetica"><B>IU:
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica"><BR>
Absolutely.

I could see that handwriting on the wall a few years ago. That 
was obvious they were going to do it. It was really silly that 
computers didn't have modems in them. Why do you have to go out 
and buy one--why aren't they built in? Well, it took a little while but 
now they do that. I'll probably keep working with what I've got. It's 
what I'm familiar with and it sounds pretty darn good.
