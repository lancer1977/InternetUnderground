JANUARY 17, 1998
</B>
<UL>
<LI>A private plane collides with a 767 on approach to LAX. All 143 
people on the 767 die, including movie star Jack Nicholson. Stunned 
air traffic controllers watch in horror--their radar screens show the 
planes approaching different runways, hundreds of feet apart. Hours 
later, a passenger train from Philadelphia bound for Washington, 
D.C. suddenly switches tracks and slams head-on into a northbound 
freight train. Thirty-three people are killed and 86 are injured, 
including Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who suffers a 
broken collarbone.
<P>

<LI>That night, seven oil refineries in Texas and Oklahoma burst into 
flames after computerized flow-control mechanisms malfunction. The 
scene is reminiscent of the oil refinery fires that burned out of control 
during the Gulf War. 
<P>

<LI>Later that night, an electrical surge abruptly overloads switching 
systems throughout New York City, plunging the city into darkness 
during the winter's first sub-zero cold front. Key phone switching 
centers are overloaded by millions of computer-generated calls, 
knocking out phone service for the city. In the predawn hours, 
widespread looting plagues New York's posh shopping districts.
<P>

<LI>Meanwhile, thousands of Bank of America customers throughout 
Northern California are unable to withdraw funds from their ATM 
accounts. Tellers who check their accounts find no funds remaining. 
Within hours, customers are making a run on the banks demanding 
their money, but the banks refuse and shut down their computer 
systems to prevent further losses.
<P>

<LI>Later that day, a French journalist walks into CNN's Paris bureau 
with "the story of the century." Using a hidden video camera, the 
journalist has captured scenes of Saddam Hussein overseeing 
technicians in Baghdad's computer-
cluttered "war room." An editor at CNN Paris briefly reviews the tape 
and then beams it to hundreds of outlets throughout the world. The 
reporter leads the story by noting that, ironically, this "virtual 
invasion" began seven years to the day after the United States 
opened fire on Iraq.
<P>

<LI>The U.S. response is fast and furious. An air raid levels 
Baghdad's key military and economic installations, while other air 
strikes target oil pipelines and refineries. More than 12,000 civilians 
are killed in the shelling, but Hussein survives. Saddam protests that 
he did not order this "remote terrorism" (a new term coined by the 
U.S. press) but the international community dismisses his 
statements. Thousands of Iraqi citizens, enraged by their leader's 
reckless actions, storm Saddam's palace. When Hussein's guards 
open fire and kill dozens of their countrymen, Saddam's core of 
support erodes further and he is evacuated by helicopter, seeking 
refuge in Syria.
<P>

<LI>While some celebrate Saddam's downfall, the United States and 
its wired allies remain palpably shaken, their confidence badly 
diminished. A genuine celebration, however, is under way in this 
conflict's true war room--in Teheran. Senior Iranian leaders and a 
cadre of 14 computer science Ph.D.s (11 of whom were educated at 
top U.S. universities) have just executed a war against Iran's two 
most-hated enemies: the United States and Iraq. Without firing a 
shot, Iran has overthrown Saddam Hussein and wrought 
havoc in a country thousands of miles away, a country of seemingly 
far superior military might...
The United States has fallen victim to an electronic Pearl Harbor 
and responded against the wrong adversary.

Does the above scenario seem far-fetched? Perhaps, but talk to 
military strategists studying the emerging field of information warfare, 
and they'll tell you the frightening truth: Everything in this story so far 
is well within the realm of technical possibility.

<B>
The Top 10 Reasons We Shouldn't Worry About CyberWar
</B>
</CENTER>
<P>

Martin Libicki is a senior fellow at the National Defense University, 
a strategy and training center for military officers in Washington, D.C. 
Libicki helped fuel a national dialogue on Information Warfare when 
he penned a paper in August 1995 reporting on the touchy subject 
matter. Having defined it, Libicki seems less worried about its actual 
occurrence than other experts, like Schwartau (see other sidebar). In 
fact, he has 10 good reasons why he doesn't lose sleep over the 
prospect of infowar. 
<P>
<BR>


<B>10. "It hasn't happened yet."</B>
<P>

As Libicki says, "Our security is really crap in this country, and 
nothing has happened." Since incidents tend to escalate at a 
somewhat predictable rate, he believes that even a turn for the worse 
wouldn't be too devastating. 
<P><BR>

<B>&nbsp;9.  "The law of averages is tough to break."</B>
<P>
The law here refers to the fact that it's easier to break into a 
system with an insider's help. Since the United State's computer 
systems are distributed widely rather than centralized, a cyberwarrior 
hoping to cause severe damage would have to enlist a lot of insiders. 
If he does, he's more likely to get caught; if he doesn't, he's less 
likely to succeed. 
<P><BR>

<B>&nbsp;8.  "Non-fatal viruses 
are a booster."</B>
<P>
We learn from each amateur attempt to hack into large systems, 
especially successful ones.
<P>
<BR>
<B>&nbsp;7.  "Someday, firewalls 
may work."</B>
<P>
We may eventually learn how to lock out intruders, rather than 
leaving our back doors open, since, as Libicki points out, "There's no 
such thing as a forced entry in cyberspace."
<P><BR>

<B>&nbsp;6.  "Local PCs can have 
viruses, as long as you keep the servers clean." </B>
<P>
And it's possible to build semantic barriers around our servers, so 
that they accept only the type of data you program them to accept. 
<P><BR>
<B>&nbsp;5.  "Digital signatures are 
better than passwords."</B>
<P>
The Department of Defense cannot single-handedly fend off the 
specter of information warfare, "and it ought not to." Libicki believes 
security needs to happen from the grass roots up, and the integration 
of digital signatures in mail programs will be a big step.

<P><BR>
<B>&nbsp;4.  "CD-ROMs are unerasable."</B>
<P>  
We have other options for storing and passing information besides 
the fragile magnetic disk.  
<P><BR>


<B>&nbsp;3.  "Air makes a 
good insulator."</B>
<P>
Libicki recalls a scene from War Games where teen hacker 
Matthew Broderick phones into a NORAD computer and kicks off a 
nuclear conflict. "That's probably not the first computer I'd hang a 
modem on." Or to put it another way, if you don't want hackers to 
mess with your system, don't put it on the Internet. 
<P><BR>

<B>&nbsp;2.  "Neither snow, nor wind, 
nor quake..."</B>
<P>
The U.S. lost $25 billion of its GNP in a blizzard last winter. 
Hurricane Andrew may have cost that much, the Northridge 
earthquake cost $10 billion, the S&L scandal cost $150 billion and 
counting. "It takes a hell of a lot to bring the U.S. to its knees." 
<P><BR>
 
<B>&nbsp;1.  "If somebody really, really pisses us off, we can always make 
the rubble bounce." </B>
<P>
"Let's say Iran wants to bring the country to its knees. We have 
other ways to convince them they might not want to do that...I don't 
have to spell this out, do I?" 
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The potential targets of information warfare today range from 
telecommunications systems and  power production, to automated 
banking machines and air traffic control. In short, wherever a country 
links to networked computer systems, it is vulnerable to attack. "The 
good guys have to protect every single one of the entry points," says 
Winn Schwartau, author of <I>Information Warfare  and 
Cyberterrorism</I>. "The bad guys only have to find one hole."
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And what about the video in the above scenario? Clearly, it was 
fabricated, using the same multimedia techniques that allowed 
Natalie Cole to sing a duet with her long-dead father and that 
enabled Forrest Gump to interact with JFK and LBJ.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Today, the techniques of combining live actors with computer-
generated video graphics can easily create a virtual news conference 
(or) summit meeting," says Prof. George J. Stein of the United States 
Air Force Air War College. "This moves well beyond traditional 
military deception, and now, perhaps, pictures will be worth a 
thousand tanks."
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While the United States has yet to fall victim to an electronic Pearl 
Harbor, thousands of less dramatic invasions of its life support 
systems have occurred. Consider:
<P>
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="arial, helvetica">

<UL>
<LI>A Russian hacker tapped into the computers of New York's 
Citibank and stole $10 million by electronically transferring the money 
to banks around the world. Other hackers have stolen millions of 
dollars, but banks generally 
keep these infiltrations quiet to maintain public confidence in financial 
systems.
<P>

<LI>To test U.S. resistance against a cyberattack,  the Defense 
Information Systems Agency (DISA)  in 1994 assembled a team of 
hackers and, in so many words, said, "Go ahead, make our day." The 
hackers snatched control of 88 percent of Pentagon computers they 
attacked, and only 4 percent of the  intrusions were noticed by 
Defense Department computer technicians.

<P>

<LI>And the home pages of the U.S. Department of Justice and the 
CIA were hacked into in the past couple of months, causing acute 
embarrassment to both agencies. "The Department of Injustice" 
page, a protest against the Communications Decency Act, had 
images of Hitler, a digitally altered topless Jennifer Aniston and 
George Washington saying, "Move my grave to a free country." On 
the CIA page, the hackers renamed the agency the "Central Stupidity 
Agency.' CIA officials tried to downplay the breach by saying no 
sensitive information was compromised.

<P>

<LI>In September, hackers paralyzed a New York ISP called Panix 
using a strategy that experts believe could disable just about any 
service provider in the world. On Sept. 6, Panix's computers began 
receiving streams of packets with phony return addresses, locking up 
Panix's computers while they tried to 
verify the addresses.

Also vulnerable to attack are the military's own command and 
control mechanisms, which are increasingly dependent on computers 
for basic operations.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Nearly everything (the military) does--from designing weapons 
and guiding missiles to paying, training, equipping and mobilizing 
soldiers--depends on computer-driven civilian information networks," 
according to "Information Warfare: A Two-Edged Sword," a 1995 
report from RAND, a public policy thinktank based in Santa Monica, 
Calif. "About 95 percent of military communications travel over the 
same phone networks used to fax a contract or to talk with a friend in 
another state. American military bases are powered by the national 
electric power grid. Pentagon purchases are paid for via the federal 
banking network. Soldiers are transported under the guidance of 
civilian rail and air traffic control systems. Each of these information 
nodes represents a substantial vulnerability for the military in times of 
crisis," the report states.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What's most frightening to some defense experts is that the tools 
needed to wage an infowar are remarkably inexpensive and national 
boundaries are penetrable to remote intrusions from thousands of 
miles away. Information warfare has no front line and battlefields can 
be any of the millions of points that networks allow access.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"It's the great equalizer," says futurist Alvin Toffler. To wage 
information warfare "you don't have to be big and rich--that's why 
poor countries are going for this faster than technically advanced 
countries."

In this new game of war, the most valuable component is the 
hacker. And some theorists believe hackers will become the new 
mercenaries, selling their expertise to the highest bidders. During the 
Gulf War, for example, a group 
of Dutch hackers offered their services to disrupt U.S. military 
operations for $1 million, according to Pentagon officials.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The United States, however, is not merely considering how to 
defend itself from infowar attacks--it is creating its own infowar 
arsenal, which may one day (or already) include microbes that eat 
electronics and insulating material inside computers (similar to micro-
organisms that consume spilled oil). Another potential weapon is the 
"logic bomb" which is insinuated into an enemy's computer or 
weapons system and gives the perpetrator the ability to later trigger it 
and erase all data within the target.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And the United States already appears to be adopting hacker-like 
techniques into its intelligence operations. On Aug. 4, <I>The Sunday 
Times of London</I> reported that system operators at the European 
Parliament and European Union detected infiltrations from the C.I.A. 
The presumed reason: to gather information to assist U.S. industry in 
trade negotiations.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While the capability to wage an infowar is growing throughout the 
world, the question is how these new forms of warfare will 
revolutionize conflict. Infowar may allow the United States to 
accomplish some important national security goals "without the need 
for 
forward-deployed military forces 
in every corner of the planet," 
Stein says.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Though an infowar would be waged largely through 
communications networks, "it is fundamentally not about satellites, 
wires and computers," Stein says. "It is about influencing human 
beings and the decisions they make."
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are military leaders who believe that infowar will spare 
civilian casualties. "This is America's gift to warfare," says Admiral 
William Owens, former vice chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
<BR>
<IMG WIDTH=175 HEIGHT=201 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="dead.gif" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 ALT="dead">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Other military theorists are less sanguine. "I have a hard time 
visualizing that warfare will be a video game devoid of pain," Lt. 
General Jay Garner said in a published report last year.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yet what about the ethics of waging information warfare? Do ethics 
even apply to information warfare? Governments could take the more 
scrupulous route and attempt to disable an adversary's missile 
guidance system...or more viciously, undermine civilian 
transportation and foreign financial systems.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Information attacks can have consequences that are as 
unpredictable as attacks aimed at physical destruction or killing 
people, says Air Force Col. Richard Szafranski. Using a "false reality" 
to "unhinge a non-combatant from reality, especially when those 
effects cannot be known or controlled, may be no less wrongful  than 
to force another into starvation or cannibalism," he says. 
Whatever the future of warfare is, there's one underlying reality. 
Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman said it a century ago, 
"War is cruelty--you cannot refine it."
