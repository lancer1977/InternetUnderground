They lived in a store called The White Elephant. It's the kind of place 
that never rotates its inventory off the shelves. Toys from decades 
past are still sitting in their rightful places, sporting their original 
prices. Sometimes, a door disappears behind a messy pile of boxes, 
and a storeroom is forgotten for years. By the time a clerk glances at 
the blueprints and opens it back up, it's a grown-up's Christmas, the 
secret dream of every toy 
collector--a forgotten vault from another era.
<BR>  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was at the White Elephant that Pam Green stumbled onto a 
collection of  punk-rock Jem dolls. Green, a money-conscious 
student at the time, was impressed by the fact that the proprietors 
were selling off the campy divas for ten bucks apiece, when 
collectors were willing to pay between $20 and $40 for a doll. To this 
day, she's never sold any of that day's find, but was pleased to be 
able to start off her toy collecting so affordably. Now Green is in the 
full swing of the hobby--author of a Web page 
(<A HREF="http://weber.u.washington.edu/~pkgreen/pamstoys.html">
http://weber.u.washington.edu/ ~pkgreen/pamstoys.html</A>) and a  participant in that ever changing 
worldwide conversation better known as the Usenet newsgroups. 
<BR>  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Usenet is the heart of the toy-collecting community online," says 
Eric G. Myers,  creator  of a Web site called Raving Toy Maniac 
(<A HREF="http://www.mdacc.tmc.edu/~neuro/eric/rtm/rtm.html">
http://www.mdacc.tmc.edu/ ~neuro/eric/rtm/rtm.html</A>).
 He believes this wholeheartedly. 
Although Web pages have transformed the collector's world, the sites 
can suffer from being static and one-sided. It's in newsgroups such 
as rec.toys.misc and rec.toys.
action-figures (which Myers helped develop) that the essentials of 
the hobby take place--gossip, trading, support and admiration. "The 
whole hobby is experiencing a real boom right now," Myers says. 
"The explosion of sites related to action figures and toys in general is 
just incredible, and I think it's been over the last year that that's really 
bloomed."

FALLING IN LOVE
</B> 
<P>  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To the toy connoisseur, the choice of toy is nearly as personal and 
important 
as one's life work or spouse. Thousands of dollars and hundreds of 
hours are spent on these playthings. How do people meet and fall in 
love with "their" toys?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
An unwary Suzanne Rich was led into an addictive LEGO habit 
when she found out that a train set she liked was going to be 
discontinued. "I was just terrified that I wasn't going to be able to get 
this set, so that collector instinct came out. I bought that train set, 
and that was it: It was like an <I>avalanche</I> after that." Rich, 
author of Suzanne's  LEGOphile Homepage 
(<A HREF="http://sebago.internet.com/~srich/">http://sebago.internet.com/~srich/</A>), 
owns about 200 sets, which adds up to about 22,000 
pieces. "Now that I have a real job," she explains, "I'm able to 
buy all the toys that I wanted as 
a kid."

Action Girl's Guide to Female Action Figures 
(<A HREF="http://members.aol.com/sarahdyer/index.htm">
http://members.aol.com/ sarahdyer/index.htm</A>) 
is penned by Sarah Dyer, a comic 
artist. Her site is a vast encyclopedia of female figures such as 
Catwoman, <I>Star Trek's</I> Tasha Yar and <I>ReBoot</I>'s Dot 
Matrix. Her hobby is a logical extension of her comic, <I>Action 
Girl</I>. "I'm not really a comics collector, and I don't read a lot of 
comics, 
especially modern comics," Dyer says. "But I started collecting 
the old <I>Supergirl</I> and <I>Wonder Woman</I> and then weird 
characters that were girls." Her specialty leapfrogged from there.

David Hall, who runs Dave's Wonderful World of Yo-Yos, 
(<A HREF="http://www.nmia.com/~whistler/yo-yos.html">http://www.nmia.com/ ~whistler/yo-yos.html</A>) says the Smothers 
Brothers sparked his lifelong fascination with yo-yos. "The geometry 
and the dynamics of the yo-yo, it's such a complicated thing, and yet 
it's so simple," Hall rhapsodizes. "I mean, you can see a piece of 
string attached to a piece of wood and 
it spins. It's so simple that you can't even mathematically precisely 
determine what's going on, but you get a sixth sense about it."
<BR>  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One thing is indisputable--the super-kitschy decades of times past 
inspire the avid toy collector. Green's fetish for the pink-haired, 
fishnet-stockinged Jem stems from the fact that "in a way, Barbie 
could never capture this period 
of the '80s. Jem dolls have these weird funky clothes." Barbie 
projects a more sanitized and timeless image. Similarly, Adam 
Tyner's interest in He-Man action figures 
(<A HREF="http://www.awod.com/gallery/rwav/ctyner/he-mant.html">
http://www.awod.com/gallery/ rwav/ctyner/he-mant.html</A>) 
is borne of nostalgia for his childhood in 
the decade of  the Masters of the Universe. However, Dyer finds her 
inspiration in another timeline. "I find that the comics coming out 
now--they have nothing to offer me. There's nothing in them that I'm 
interested in, but I went back and found comics made before I was 
even reading them, mostly '60s comics, and I just really enjoy them." 
<BR>  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These collectors are serious about what they do. They work hard 
to track down rare models, write extensive catalogs, fact-check and 
photograph. Do they ever find time to play? To Hall, the yo-yo is 
"more than just a toy, it's an entire hobby. It's a toy in that I buy the 
new ones, and I play with them, I can do almost all the advanced 
tricks. It's very recreational and great for relaxation. But at the same 
time it's intellectually stimulating trying to find avenues of finding 
more for the collection."

THE NET CONNECTION 
</B>
<P>  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rich's favorite pastime with LEGO is piecing together sets and 
scenarios that LEGO doesn't officially make, such as an intricate 
chessboard. She finds that her cohorts on the Net egg her on. "It's 
really fun when people see [the creations], and they write to you and 
say, ÎOh, I really like the way you used that piece,' and they actually 
<I>know</I> that piece pretty well," she laughs. "It's neat, because a 
lot of people in the physical world around me have no clue why I do 
this, or don't know anything about LEGO, or aren't really interested, 
but on the Internet, you're apt to bump into somebody with the same 
weirdo interest as you."
<BR>  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dave Hall uses the Net to keep in touch with a group of yo-yo 
fanatics. "It's really important to [compare notes] because a lot of 
these companies, like the old Duncan company, didn't keep very 
accurate records of exactly what they made or when they made it." 
One of Hall's goals is to fill in 
gaps in the historical timeline and record stories of yo-yo culture. For 
her part, Jem collector Green actually says that her collecting habits 
have changed because of her Web page. Now she says she often 
thinks of her Web site first and her collection second when coming 
upon newly discovered dolls and accessories. The possibility of 
communication, of dialogue, has transformed a hobby that can lean 
toward the self-indulgent into a kind of education. For instance, Tyner 
scoured DejaNews to find everyone who had ever written a word 
about He-Man. "I compiled a list," says Tyner. "It started out with 12 
names, and now there are over 250 people who get my newsletter. It 
was one or two in the morning on winter vacation. I'm not sure why I 
did it, it seems odd now, but I'm glad I did." His site thrives due to this 
tight community of He-Man fans. Myers echoes these themes of 
sharing and community-building. "In terms of bringing us together as 
individuals that are sharing a love for these things," he says, "the 
Internet has become the medium of choice. I can't think of how I 
would do this and get as much enjoyment out 
of it if I didn't have the Internet, the Web pages, and especially, 
primarily, the Usenet newsgroups."

FOR LOVE OR MONEY? 
</B>
<P>  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The hobby has long felt 
the schism between those who collect for love and those who do it 
for money.  "Unfortunately, now, we're seeing an invasion of people 
who are really into speculating," Myers says. "The popular term for 
them is Îscalpers.'" Scalpers make it their business to buy up hot or 
short-packed items. They then re-sell them immediately at inflated 
prices. This practice is easily the most inflammatory debate in the 
community, because scalping is highly visible when dealers post 
unreasonable prices in the newsgroups.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"If you want to make an investment, go buy stocks and bonds," 
Myers sighs. "The toy market is right on the brink of a major 
correction." He explains that toys are being hyped and marketed 
using many of the methods of the now-collapsed comics industry. 
"The problem with toys is that you can take a toy <I>back</I>. You 
can take it back, and get your money back, or get a credit at the 
store. Try doing that with a comic or an open pack of trading cards. 
You can't do it. So until stores are really willing to address their 
return policies, the action figure and toy speculation market will 
continue because 
it's really a very low-risk venture." Sure, everyone's heard the stories 
about people who socked away the <I>Star Wars</I> line in 1979 
and made a mint. But because of those very stories, Myers says, 
"every action figure released in the last five years will be in very good 
supply in the coming years. In great condition, too." His ultimate 
advice is, "If you stick with what you like, you can't go wrong. If 
you're chasing the latest trend, you're more than likely going to wind 
up with a worthless piece of plastic that you're going to try to sell in 
a year." 
<BR>  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dyer agrees that people should remember the inherent joy and fun 
in toys. She keeps her "girl army" spread out around her office and 
rearranges them when she's bored. "I'm definitely not one of those 
people who is collecting for value and keeping them on the card and 
everything," she says. 
<BR>  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The overriding feeling permeating the toy pages is one of good 
karma and a refreshingly innocent set of ethics. "It's all right to not 
make a profit. It's all right to just collect and trade and not rip 
people off. It's all right to help people out," Myers says. "If I had to 
make a slogan for the newsgroup, it would be, <I>This can be 
a collaborative and cooperative venture if you want it to be</I>."
