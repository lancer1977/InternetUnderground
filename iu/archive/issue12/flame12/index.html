I was in a rut; surf, eat, sleep, surf, eat, sleep. 
<P>
Then I heard about a possible cure for my blahs. Andersen 
Consulting was starting a new service on the Web that, among other 
things, promised to find the Web sites that I secretly desired. I never 
even knew I "secretly desired" Web sites, but I figured what the heck, 
why not try it?
<P>
After all, businesses pay billions of dollars to consulting companies 
like Andersen every year. Andersen comes in and studies the 
situation and then makes recommendations as to how the company 
can bust out of its rut. And here I was, going to get their expert 
advice for free!
<P>
Admittedly, the service was in its infancy when I tested it, but 
again, it had the Andersen name on it. A prestigious multimillion 
dollar firm isn't going to sully its good name by putting some half-
baked idea up on the Web, right? Right?
<P>
So, I punched in the URL (<A HREF="http://lifestyle.cstar.ac.com/lifestyle/">http://lifestyle.cstar.ac.com/
lifestyle/</A>) and behold! I was greeted by Waldo the Web Wizard, who 
claimed he could see my future, my dreams, my hopes and the Web 
sites that I "secretly desired."
<P>
"Wow! Waldo's finally going to get me those URLs with doctored 
GIFs of Alicia Silverstone," I thought to myself. 
<P>
All Waldo asked in return was that I answer "a few soul-revealing 
questions from the mystical archives of wisdom." Hmmmmm, soul-
revealing questions? Was Waldo going to probe my feelings on 
religion? Politics? The meaning of life? This guy seemed serious. I 
hesitated for a moment. I'm not one of these privacy nuts, but still--
"soul-revealing questions"--I don't usually like to give out my home 
phone number when registering at a site. Still, Waldo was promising 
me a lot: "Do this--and Waldo will guide you straight to the Web sites 
you'll find so interesting you'll think they were created just for 
you...after showing you the Web sites you really want to see most, 
Waldo will reveal to you the secret reasons how Waldo the Web 
Wizard's LifestyleFinder will help change your life--forever."
<P>
Change my life? Web sites tailored just for me? And all I had to do 
was answer some soul-probing questions? Sign me up!

My appetite keen, I clicked on Waldo's crystal ball. But before we 
could get started, Waldo fired back with a disclaimer. Something 
about being only a prototype and how Andersen doesn't guarantee 
the results. Whatever. They were just trying to weed out the rubes. I 
believed in Waldo and no legal mumbo jumbo was going to rain on 
my parade. I desperately clicked forward.
<P>
"Behold! Waldo senses one of these scenes resembles what you 
watch on television...kindly show Waldo what you watch most on the 
tube."
<P>
This was soul-revealing?Anyway, I had to choose one of six 
cheesily-drawn cartoons (by comparison, <I>Hi and Lois</I> is 
DaVinci) that pigeon-holed my viewing tastes. There was no choice 
that said "NBC on Thursdays except for the new Brooke Shields 
show and <I>The Single Guy</I>, plus <I>X-Files</I>, <I>The 
Tick</I>, The <I>Simpsons</I>, and Cubs, Bears, Bulls, Michigan and 
Northwestern games," so I picked the category "sitcoms." Since 
"sitcom" is a pretty loose category encompassing everything from 
<I>Seinfeld</I> and <I>Frasier</I> to <I>Full House</I> and <I>Family 
Matters</I>, I must say at this point, I was starting to have my 
suspicions about this Waldo fellow. Still, I decided to give him 
another chance. 
<P>
Next, Waldo asked me what I like to do after coming home from 
work (it's noteworthy at this point that, after professing my taste for 
sitcoms, Waldo gleaned that I was gainfully employed). Again, I was 
given six choices about "preferred activities" in the form of six cheesy 
cartoons. Since "sitting in front of the TV with a cold Rolling Rock" 
was not one of the options, I informed Waldo that I liked to participate 
in sports.
<P>
I can see by my word count that I'm running out of space, so I'll 
have to cut to the chase. Waldo went on to ask me what kind of 
house I live in, what kind of beverage I like to consume, what my 
favorite part of the newspaper is and what kind of music I like. Each 
time I had my pick of six cheesy cartoons. 
<P>
Anyway, in the end, here is the portrait Waldo drew of me: "Waldo 
can see your apartment...which to you is a welcomed haven after a 
long day of work. It's a place to relax with friends, listen to music and 
eat jerky-based snacks. Waldo knows you enjoy the sun, friendship 
and chewy chunks of dried beef." 
<P>
And what about those Web sites tailored specifically for me? 
Waldo came up with 15 sites. Of those 15, I can say I was 
realistically interested in only three. Some of Waldo's misses: sites 
for Bell motorcycle helmets, Chase Bank credit cards, Kelly-
Springfield tires, Majerle's Sports Grill (in Phoenix), the National 
Automotive and Truck Museum and Shooter's Billiards Supplies & 
Sales. 
<P>
These were the Web sites I secretly desired? Please. Using 
URouLette, I had a better chance of finding enjoyable sites. OK, so 
maybe this is an exaggeration. The first site URouLette sent to me 
was for the Scrap Plastic Depot, but you get the point.
<P>
My advice? Don't waste your time with Waldo.
