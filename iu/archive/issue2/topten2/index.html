The editors of suck strive to debunk the corporate media frenzy attacking the Web, fighting "literary 
laziness" by providing thought-provoking content on a daily basis. Cleanly designed and well written, 
suck editors sprinkle hyperlinks throughout their text to move their stories forward. Their topics range 
from the absurd number of tepid "cool" sites to pointing readers to a book probing what would happen if 
Nietzsche worked at a convenience store. Arguably one of the most worthwhile reads on the Web, this 
site will help you learn what's going on behind the hype and the links of the 'net.

John Walker's site of various science toys, though seemingly simple at first, quickly explodes the myth 
of the Web as a passive learning tool. One of the few sites in which it's possible to lose countless hours, 
Walker's simulations take better advantage of their medium than any other science site we've seen. 
Cship, our personal favorite, explains the theory of relativity by taking you on a ship traveling close to 
the speed of light and then using MPEGs and JPEGs to show how the rest of the surrounding 
environment shifts. Cship is only one of several such experiments, however -- there's much more to this 
site than we could possibly give justice to in a short description. Of course, when you create a new 
planet daily (check out the Terranova page), putting up a complex Web site must not seem too hard.

Are Tasmanian devils extinct? Is there such a thing as a kosher Chinese restaurant? Is there a place to 
get hard liquor in Disneyland? Are gerbils illegal in California? To find out, you'll have to read the lengthy 
Frequently Asked Questions of alt.folklore.urban, a document filled with the astonishing truth about 
commonly repeated rumors and "facts." Each entry is flagged as true, possibly true, blatantly false or 
probably not true, but scientifically possible. However, even the knowledgeable FAQ can't be certain if 
Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.

In this holy site on the Web, learn the sacred laws, myths and comic teachings on the importance of 
slack from  the Rev. "Bob" Dobbs. Every visit to the Church requires a check into the rants of members 
in the Hall of Answers, where you read about everything from Microwave Harassment and Mind-Control 
Experimentation (Part II only) and a studious look at slack and dogs. It's worth the navigation to search 
for The Endless FAQ. (Pity the poor soul who expects a detailed, anal-retentive archive source on a 
group called alt.slack.) The SubGenius altar recently added radio capabilities to the site, so you can 
hear Bob's preachings yourself. All slackers give praise to Bob!

Ever wondered if the Munsters could beat the Addams Family on <I>Family Feud</I>? Or if Gary Coleman 
could take Webster in an old-fashioned street brawl? How about whether Mr. Clean could hold his own 
is a bar brawl with Mr. T? Two Cornell college students have, and they took their musings to the Web in 
the form of weekly grudge matches. After reading the setting and commentary from the site's authors 
you get to cast your vote on the outcome. And despite popular opinion we think Herman and company 
would whip Gomez et. al.

Not much glitz, just an exhaustive resource of TV theme songs there for the downloading. This 
collection is amazing, ranging from old stand-bys (<I>The Brady Bunch</I>, <I>Gilligan's Island</I>) to forgotten 
classics (<I>Six Million Dollar Man</I>, <I>Top Cat</I>) to themes no one could possibly hum (<I>Punky Brewster</I>, 
<I>Vega$</I>). Special bonus: There's a whole <I>Schoolhouse Rock</I> section. The sound quality isn't perfect, but 
this is <I>Hong Kong Phooey</I>, not Vivaldi, so who cares?

Aussie Peter Moore named his irreverent travel site after a real sign he encountered on a trek to China. 
The sign made no sense, but that's just the point; much of traveling comes with the unexpected, and 
that's just fine by Moore. In his site, he offers loads of advice written in a wonderful humorous voice.Top 
choices here are the sections detailing romance on the road and the Top 10 bum steers that well-
known travel guide books offer tourists. We'd travel with Moore anywhere.

This site, created by Purdue graduate student Alaa Ashwamy, manages to take one of those topics 
everyone knows exists (though few know little more than that) and make it both entertaining and 
enlightening. Chock-full of hyperlinks and facts that are only sort of useless (for example, the word 
mausoleum comes from the Tomb of Maussollos at Halicarnassus), the Seven Wonders page even 
posts a few replacements for the absent six monuments, offering up comparatively modern creations 
like Angkor Wat, the Eiffel Tower and the Colosseum. No word yet as to whether South Dakota's Corn 
Palace is under consideration.
