<B>Welcome to our tour!</B> Remember, hands and feet inside the tram at all times. Please, no flash photography. Before we begin our journey to home pages of the obscure stars, I'll offer a brief introduction to the tour. You see, ladies and gentlemen, if you look around you'll find the Web littered with shrines to stars and celebrities of all ilk. While the number of Alicia Silverstone pages might be overwhelming, if you consider the Web's demographics, it's understandable. But somewhere among the  sites for Winona Ryder and James Dean, you come across a home page for a star that just makes you scratch your head, and mutter, "Why?" For instance, why would someone devote a space on the bandwidth to Karen Allen?  "I had been a big fan of hers for many, many years, collecting photos, interviews, videos etc. The Web simply provided me with a good way to 'display' my collection,"  explains Patrick Spreng the designer of the Allen page. It makes sense when you consider people post the contents of their fridge online. While most of the sites we'll visit on our tour are loving tributes to overlooked actors, some have higher purposes. Harrison Cheung, the creator of the Christian Bale site, actually corresponds with Bale monthly. Cheung thinks his site will eventually boost Bale's career:  His audience is young and very computer literate. Given that (Bale) doesn't get much traditional publicity, the home page functions as a resource for fans, the press and casting agents.  Well, you didn't pay to hear me talk all day. Let's get on with our tour. I believe our first home page is coming up on the left. Once again, let me remind you no flash photography.

<I>
As if anyone questioned Karen Allen's downward career path, the actress has gone from 
starring in Animal House with John Belushi to starring in a CD-ROM with Jimmie Walker. This 
site is actually quite good, with meticulously detailed pages, dozens of photos, and lots of 
links, but all this work for the star of Ghost in the Machine? Well, at least Karen probably 
appreciates the adoration, right? A direct quote after the author gives her address: "Note that, 
while I have sent her several fan letters over the past five years, I have never received any 
response. Let me know if you do!"

<I>
Christian is a well-respected young actor and all that, but he's still a mite obscure to merit a fan 
home page. With his next two projects being adaptations of literary classics by James and 
Conrad, Christian's home page is probably the most mainstream exposure he can expect to get.

By listing Erin's complete film/TV listings you can trace her career from </I>Buck Rogers</I> to </I>Jason 
Goes to 
Hell: The Final Friday<I>. Gray 
was a model, so the site likely includes hot GIFs. It seems that Gray merits a home page for 
starring in Buck Rogers, putting her into the cyberbabe arena along with Gillian Anderson, Teri 
Hatcher and every woman who's
 ever been on </I>Star Trek.

Not just one, but two sites for every mid-'70s adolescents' dream date. Apparently Kristy has 
suffered from personal problems over the last couple of years, yet both pages' authors seem to 
know very little about her current status other than the fact she did appear on the finale of 
Empty Nest. If you have any Kristy info please pass it on to her die-hard fans.

If you opened up the dictionary and looked under obscure, you probably wouldn't find Pamela's 
picture, but that's less a testament to her obscurity and more to the fact dictionaries, despite the 
popular clich», usually only have pictures for words that are nouns, not adjectives.
