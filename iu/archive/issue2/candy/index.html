Well, it wasn't exactly a conversation. I dropped CandyMan some e-mail, naively suggesting that since we 
had accounts on the same access provider, we obviously both lived in the metropolitan Chicago area. 
Perhaps we could meet? I assured him of my willingness to keep his identity anonymous.

<P> 

     His ominous response: "<TT>It is out of the question that we meet face to face.</TT>" 

<P>

     I felt a bit foolish. After all, he does act as the keeper of a great deal of controversial and threatened 
speech on bombs, drugs and fraud. In the aftermath of the Oklahoma bombing, his site and others became 
targets for censor-happy conservatives who feel "dangerous" topics should be taken off the 'net. Recently, 
America Online put its lawyers on his tail for distributing instructions on hacking into the online service's 
software for free access. They made him take the information off his site at http://www.mcs.net/~candyman/
home.html. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=1>(Candyland has been permanently shut down due to a disagreement with the service provider. Stay tuned to <I>underground-online</i> for the new URL.)
</FONT SIZE=1>

<P>

	So I asked for a telephone interview. I gave him my phone number and, like a gullible coed, I waited for 
a phone call that would never come. The next time I logged on, I had e-mail from the CandyMan, instructing 
me to write up my questions and send them to him in a file titled "Interview" so he could consider the merit 
of my questions.

<P>


	Hmmm. I wasn't used to all this weighing, judging and qualification. But I wrote up a list and e-mailed it 
over. Apparently it hit the mark. CandyMan sent me a polite e-mail telling me that he would respond 
in essay format and that he would be willing to follow up with a UNIX talk session.

<P>

	A co-worker whose idea of privacy is closing the miniblinds looked puzzled when I mentioned the terms 
and constraints of the interview. She said, "Have you offered to meet him in a church and speak through 
the screen of the confessional booth?" We smirked at the idea, but it made us think. I had shared quite a bit 
of information with this stranger and with many other faceless entities on the 'net. After reading the 
information on CandyLand, I started to wonder if perhaps those of us who are overly 
trusting are the real weirdos in this world.

<P>
 
	When I spoke with him, CandyMan shattered any lingering stereotypes that I might have had of 
anarchists or hackers. He didn't deconstruct spelling or capitalization like many subversives do: I didn't 
even see a stray "d00d." He was polite, articulate and carefully considered his answers. We even had fun 
comparing ideas. This was no mad bomber or lawless freak -- just an intelligent, 19-year-old college student 
looking to keep information the way he likes it: absolutely free.

CM:</B><BR><TT> Before the Internet came into my view, I used to call up various local BBSs in the Chicago area. As I 
browsed through them, I noticed some advertising for other systems and noticed some forums that I began 
to read. As time went by, I grew interested in "underground" topics. Then later down the road, I began 
browsing various sites on the Internet. I liked the Internet because of the large forum, and the fact that any 
information can be provided to a large audience. I did notice there were some sites specializing in 
underground content, but it seemed none were really 
comprehensive on the issues.
<P>  
	I also believe that First Amendment rights 
are very important and in some cases should be...not <I>challenged</I>, exactly...but the right to freedom of 
speech and press should be exercised and defended. I believe that no information should be restricted no 
matter what the topic/content. In providing the information, I keep it alive, so to speak. I keep the 
information available in the "library" so that if individuals do wish to seek it out it, it is unrestricted and the 
individual can perform/apply his or her own morals or responsibility to the info they find in their searches. </TT><BR><BR>

<B>
CM:</B><BR><TT> It is difficult to forecast or categorize the appreciativeness of the individuals on the net versus those 
who are ignorant of it because the net is a very diverse community.  Furthermore, as time goes by, the 
number of individuals in who can be categorically called ignorant of the 'net will be slim to none due to the 
occurrence of more and more organizations, schools and companies being connected to the Internet. I 
would agree, though, that a large percentage of the disapprovals do seem to be fielded by individuals who 
are ignorant of the ways of the Internet community.  Furthermore, I would attribute this disapproval to media 
hype.  The fact that the different major media networks compete for ratings and will be as exploitative as 
possible to achieve the top ratings is nothing new.
<P>
	The problem here is that they are no longer performing their duties in that they are to be reporting the 
news; rather they are involved in the action of distorting the news when they relay it to the mass audience.  
The most notable is their fascination with the 'net; 99 percent  of the time they are reporting on something 
about which they have little or no knowledge. Most of the reporters think that AOL is the Internet. I would 
venture to say that nine out of 10 reports or specials relating to the 'net are negative, exploitative and 
distorted whose only purpose is to receive top ratings. The victims of this type of behavior are a 
misinformed general public, a persecuted 'net community, and the right to freedom of speech that is 
jeopardized through proposed Internet regulation.</TT>

CM:</B><BR><TT> At times in the past, I have consciously struggled with these moral distinctions.  After further reflection 
on the matter, I concluded that the institution of these morals would ultimately be the act of censorship, and 
furthermore the imposition of another individual's morals upon a mass audience.  Moreover, morality is a 
realm that individuals themselves define and practice for themselves. Thus the defined morals of a central 
individual should not be imposed onto others.
<P> 
	Therefore, I have disseminated the information, thus allowing the individual's own values, 
responsibility, morals and actions govern over those who shall ultimately dictate whether the 
information is retrieved and whether it is used or misused. Utilizing the above set of rationales 
allows for the visitor to exercise his or her own individual responsibility and choose the path best 
suited for him or herself.
<P>
	To an extent, I do perceive that academic elements of the discussion are indeed separate from 
the acts that they imply.  The reason for this is that several of the plans found within the site offer 
scientific or social merit.  Furthermore, the portions of information that are found within the site are 
at times studied by individuals, organizations or companies for enlightenment about the strategies 
of fraud that may be waged against them.  Through their study, they are able to institute the proper 
counterstrategies to combat the fraud that they may or may not be subjected to.</TT>

geographical borders and charge inflated fees to the general 
consumer.  A few of the cases could be viewed as a protest against the large establishments. More often

the maker/bystanders/victims. The visitors are urged to read through an introductory book of chemistry 
among other things. There is also a Safety file, which is the very first file in the listing of files.  This file 
notifies individuals of the proper methods/tips an individual constructing an explosive device must follow.  
Plus there are several warnings/safety tips within most of the plans.  If an individual is harmed from the 
construction of these explosives, it is due to their lack of safety procedures and ignorance of chemistry and 
pyrotechnics.

	Also, it is insecure due to the fact that all other information that is transmitted over the Internet is 
insecure. The fact is that the info is almost always transferred as unencrypted text in sending packets from 
site to site until it reaches its destination. If there happens to be a packet sniffer at any point along the path, 
then the info is compromised.</TT>

CandyMan and I wrapped up our interview, clarifying some key points and making pleasant small talk. To 
my now world-weary amusement, he declined my offer to send him free copies of this issue because it 
would mean having to reveal his mailing address. We agreed, instead, that he would buy a copy on the 
newsstand in order to preserve his valuable 
anonymity and underground lifestyle.
