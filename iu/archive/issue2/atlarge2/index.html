<B>I must say,</B> 1995 was a great year for me.  I went 
	from licking stamps and making photocopies at 
	temporary jobs to licking stamps and making 
	photocopies for fun in my leisure time. I spent 
	another year living in my parents' house, patting my cats on their heads and using Kai's Power Tools to fix images of my 
bald spot. If my growing success with the Texture Explorer is any indication, 1996 will be even better.
<P>

	Still, there is a lot of room for improvement.  I need to become more active -- typing faster hasn't affected my cardiovascular 
system like I'd hoped.  
I need to open myself to other avenues and experiences. Find myself a girlfriend; maybe two or three. 
I was thinking of having one for each of my e-mail addresses.
<P>
	I know I should also read more, maybe write a screenplay, learn to play a musical instrument and learn a foreign language. I 
could work out, learn to meditate, do yoga or karate. Possibly even try a yoga/karate hybrid, although I'll need to be careful not 
to kick myself in the face. 
<P>
	Those are all big steps.  Right now, I spend most of my time either sitting at my computer or being passed out a few feet 
away from it. That's why, despite my psychiatrists' urgings, I've decided to leave the above resolutions for 1997.
<P>
That doesn't mean I won't make important changes in 1996. Here's a few.

<HR NOSHADE>
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=108462>I plan to change the name I use on MUDs. Foobies? What kind of name is Foobies?  </FONT COLOR=108462></B>
Initially I used it because it's the password to my ATM card. It helped me remember it. I've been thinking of changing my 
password, though, and so now Foobies seems expendable.

<B><FONT COLOR=108462>I plan to create a more friendly search engine.</FONT COLOR=108462></B> Right now, all Web crawlers are computer-driven. This one will be 
completely organic. I'm going to do all the searching myself, by hand. I'm going to keep everything on index cards. I'm not going 
to give it a special name or anything, but you might want to call it Mirsky.
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=108462>I plan to  develop and propagate a new graphics file format</FONT COLOR=108462></B> that uses a combination of  GIF and JPEG 
technologies.  
It's  spelled  JPEGIF. It works fine. It's just
taking a long time to determine how people should 
pronounce it.
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=108462>I plan to create a new e-mail signature.</FONT COLOR=108462></B>  
With a little time, I should be able to make a much more accurate depiction of the chemical structure 
for Prozac.

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=108462>I plan to start exploring new channels on IRC 
(inter-relay chat).</FONT COLOR=108462></B> I recently learned a few Finnish swear words, so now I should have some idea when I'm about to get kicked 
out of the better ones.
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=190 HEIGHT=260 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="art/nudeman.gif" VSPACE=15 HSPACE=15>
<B><FONT COLOR=108462>I plan to read the alt.binaries.
nude.celebrities newsgroup more 
frequently. </FONT COLOR=108462></B>
I just know there were requests for my George C. Scott pics. Did I miss them again?
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=108462>I plan to stop people from talking dirty in the WebChat Lounge channels.</FONT COLOR=108462></B>
I think I can have everything under control by  copying and pasting in some song lyrics from this location: <A HREF="http://bigdipper.umd.edu/music/lyrics/reek.of.putrefaction">http://bigdipper.umd.
edu/music/lyrics/reek.of.putrefaction</A>.
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=108462>I plan to try one of those "Make money fast!" offers constantly posted on Usenet. </FONT COLOR=108462></B>
I figure if it doesn't work out, I'll just start posting messages that 
it's a big scam like everybody else.
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=108462>I plan to hack into the government site that stores everyone's immunization records.</FONT COLOR=108462></B>  
I can't remember whether I've been vaccinated for cholera. I have a very business-like relationship with my doctor and I'm too 
uncomfortable to ask. I'm also the number one fan of Holly Hunter. I can't rest until I know she's been properly inoculated.
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=108462>I plan to rename the World Wide Web.</FONT COLOR=108462></B> 
I haven't thought of what I'm going to call it yet, but it's going make 
it a lot more popular.
