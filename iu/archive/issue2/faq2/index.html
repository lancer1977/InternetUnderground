<B><FONT COLOR=006373>Can you explain alt.tasteless to those who 
haven't seen it? What's its purpose?</B></FONT COLOR=006373><BR>
It's a newsgroup devoted to tasteless phenomena in all its forms, a 
place for people with a twisted and sick sense of humour. You'll find stories about unusual and interesting  
deaths, nasty visits to 
the hospital or drunk tanks. In short, stories your parents, teachers, priests, etc. wouldn't have liked. 
Please note that this is not 
alt.tacky or alt.bad.taste. This means that merely 
saying "Bee Gees, ha ha ha" is not enough. 

<P>

<B><FONT COLOR=006373>What's your involvement?</B></FONT COLOR=006373><BR>
My connection to the group is as a contributor, FAQ-maintainer, archive-keeper, historian. And being the 
inaugural Mr. alt.tasteless. 
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=006373>How did you get involved with it?</B></FONT COLOR=006373><BR>
I was sitting at the university, hungry as hell, and was
suddenly overcome with the urge to write a fun story.
Mr. Brown from Florida wrote to me saying that he liked
it. I did too, so I continued. 1991 was a good year 
tasteless-wise. A lot of new ground was broken. 
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=006373>Is tastelessness a positive thing? If so, why?</B></FONT COLOR=006373><BR>
It's a positive thing the same way William S. Burroughs' Naked Lunch, Frank Zappa's Brown Shoes Don't 
Make It and Brett Easton Ellis' American Psycho are positive things. To some people they're definitely not. 
Burroughs is dangerously weird, Zappa sings 
"Be a jerk and go to work," American Psycho contains another bunch of feelings and thoughts that are not 
acceptable. 
   Being tasteless is a feeling. A strong feeling. You know what you like and you're not ashamed.  
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=006373>Do you have a day job? If so, what is it?</B></FONT COLOR=006373><BR>
I'm the co-editor of Denmark's largest computer magazine.
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=006373>What's a typical conversation thread like in alt.tasteless? </B></FONT COLOR=006373><BR>
Someone relays a story of a piercing or dental experience. Others chip in. It could also be about vomiting. 
These threads serve a purpose, and are sometimes funny. But it's the well-crafted stories that make 
alt.tasteless unique.
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=006373>What makes a Web site tasteless enough</B></FONT COLOR=006373><BR> 
to be part of your collection?
It has to be daring. It has to have personality. 
You see so incredibly many home pages without 
personality. Obscenity laws make that hard.
<A HREF="http://www.people.memphis.edu/~udrhooper/pops/pops.html"> 
http://www.people.memphis.edu/~udrhooper/
pops/pops.html</A> has a good opening page.
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=006373>What do you think is the most common 
thing people misunderstand about your group?</B></FONT COLOR=006373><BR>
That it is a chat group. Alt.tasteless is 
not alt.peeves or alt.flame.
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=006373>What's the oddest thing that had to be  
addressed in the alt.tasteless FAQ?</B></FONT COLOR=006373><BR>
Given the frame, it's hard to think of an odd 
thing that stands out as remarkably odd. The cutest 
thing is the Tasteless Secret Santa where people 
send each other gifts like purses made of kangaroo 
naughty bits or Shitlovers videos.

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=006373>What's the strangest thing (or couple of things) 
that you've seen online?</B></FONT COLOR=006373><BR>
Mr. New Stallion Owner's diaries in alt.sex.bestiality from the early ë90s. It is a well-written diary of an 
unusual life.
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=006373>Is your group moderated?</B></FONT COLOR=006373><BR>
No, and you can't kick people off an unmoderated alt-group. But you can burn them so hard that they 
run away. Noise makers will be tracked down and dealt with. We call it retro-
moderation.
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=006373>Are flames common in your group? What brings them on?</B></FONT COLOR=006373><BR>
Yes. Normal netters with big egos and nothing interesting to say. Can't stand them.
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=006373>Describe your computer area.</B></FONT COLOR=006373><BR>
At work, a networked PC, huge stacks of press releases, color prints, articles and such. Then there's 
my hobby room at home. It's on the second floor overlooking the garden delights (oh well, we've got a 
fairly good apple tree). Strangely enough this room looks exactly like the office at work.
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=006373>What are some of your favorite postings or 
favorite tasteless sites?</B></FONT COLOR=006373><BR>
The ë91, ë92, ë93, ë94 and ë95 archives of alt.tasteless. (They can be retrieved at 
<A HREF="http://nyx10.cs.du.edu:8001/~jnash/
alt.tasteless.html )">http://nyx10.cs.du.edu:8001/~jnash/</A>
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=006373>What are you wearing? </B></FONT COLOR=006373><BR>
Dressing gown and slippers. I must be getting old.
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=006373>What's your favorite thing to munch on when you surf?</B></FONT COLOR=006373><BR>
Ammonium chloride candies. I've never seen them in the U.S., and they seem to be quite foreign to 
Americans. You can ask bediger@csn.net what they taste like. 
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=006373>What are you favorite places to hang out on the ënet?</B></FONT COLOR=006373><BR>

 <P>
<B><FONT COLOR=006373>What would people be surprised to find out about you?</B></FONT COLOR=006373><BR>
If they meet me at work in a suit, they'd be surprised to find that I've written 500 kb of tasteless stories.
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=006373>Finally, what do people do online that make you mad?</B></FONT COLOR=006373><BR>  They bore me. They're not tasteless.
