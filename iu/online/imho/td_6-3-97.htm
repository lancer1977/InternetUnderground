In Defense Of Tiny</B></FONT><BR>

<I>Loyal readers of the e-mail section of the print magazine know that Tiny, our regular mailguy, is currently on a paid psychiatric leave. Tiny recently suffered a slight breakdown after receiving a scathing letter from a reader, who suggested Tiny might want to start combing the want ads. 
<P>
With Tiny resting comfortably at home, we've decided to leave his fate in the hands of the readers. Tiny supporters should e-mail their comments to <A HREF="mailto:mailguy@mcs.com">mailguy@mcs.com</A> with the subject line "Tiny Rules." Detractors should also e-mail their comments to <A HREF="mailto:mailguy@mcs.com">mailguy@mcs.com</A> with the subject line "Tiny Sucks." 
<P>
But don't make up your mind just yet. We've asked Tiny's half brother Elrod to pen this week's IMHO, so you could see what kind of man Tiny was, is and, with your help, someday will be.</I> 
<P>
<BR>

It's not often that a kid brother gets to come to the rescue of his older brother, 
but by God, that's what I'm forced to do. Ever since a certain someone 
suggested Tiny start "combing through the <I>Chicago Tribune</I>'s Jobs 
section," my brother's fragile ego has all but shattered. He's a big man (six-feet, 
nine-inches in thongs), and while most of the facial growths have been 
surgically removed, he can't be described as terribly alluring (only one cousin 
on our father's side of the family has a face more than a mother could love). 
Tiny's life up until his engagement in the <I>IU</I> mailroom could 
charitably be described as ruinously perverse. That is to say, he ran afoul of 
nearly every major taboo known to human society. He did not seek depravity 
for its own sake, but for his. 
<P>
Naturally, the human resources department at <I>IU</I>  didn't notice, and 
Tiny was hired on the spot. From that point forward, he changed. He turned 
over a new leaf. A new haircut (parted rigidly down the middle), a new 
wardrobe (meticulously modeled after Schneider, the gum-chewing 
maintenance man from <I>One Day at a Time</I>), a new attitude (never 
again would he use his bicycle for evil). Tiny smiled when he talked, and talked 
when he smiled, and unlike before, did so without frightening the elderly.
<P>
Today, that Tiny is a memory. And all because some Internet user found it 
impossible to resist defaming my brother's essence. What lies behind the urge 
to, as you people put it, <I>flame</I>? I suppose I should tell you that I 
devoutly ignore this Internet thing. I am a man partial to butterflies and 
peaches and homemade mittens, to the genteel things of life. I don't share this 
cultivated cynicism and adolescent irreverence you people on the Internet 
seem to prize so much. People tell me the Internet is the biggest revolution to 
hit communications technology since the invention of Federal Express. But let 
me ask you: What greater bandwidth is there than an open mind out in the 
open? 
<P>
I didn't always hold the Internet in such low regard. Granted, I train pigeons 
for a specialized vaudeville circuit, so you can imagine how little time I have 
for contemplating the world of modems and telephone lines. But I always made 
time for Tiny. I can remember my brother after his first week with <I>IU</I>. 
He'd rush home from the Lombard office, his face bright red with metabolic 
exertion, and breathlessly exclaim, "Elrod! Elrod! Look what I found online!" 
Sure enough, he'd empty a full bushel of documents he'd printed from the 
Internet that day: ravioli recipes, order forms for a Peter Lorre pi&#241;ata, 
various tracts speculating on the prolonged popularity of disc cameras in 
Belgium. And then, as often as not, terror would seize his features and he'd 
apologize for leaving so soon but he had to go back to Lombard because in his 
excitement he had forgotten to push the CD-ROM carriage back into its slot. 
As he puffed and wheezed and giggled his unwieldy form onto his bike, as he 
pedaled away and pleaded from a distance "Don't start the pizza without me!" I 
couldn't help but regret, just for a moment, having stomped on my free AOL 
disk with a pair of soccer cleats. Perhaps my half-brother fell in love with the 
Internet with the half I wasn't a brother of. But in those days, when merely 
saying "28.8" put a grin on my brother's face, when saying "ISDN" put 
chuckles in my brother's throat, when saying "PPP account" put my 
brother into restraints, I could summon a level of tolerance for that colossus of 
vapidity known as cyberspace.   
<P>
But no more. When the editors at <I>IU</I>  asked me to comment on my 
brother's recent turn for the worse, I nearly ordered a protest subscription to 
<I>Wired</I>. How can I comment on the shambles of a man my brother has become? 
Just today, in fact, I caught Tiny on all fours crouched on the linoleum floor, 
pushing a single cube of ice around and around with a grapefruit spoon. When 
I questioned this, he shot up and stated flatly, "Charlton Heston is gay." What 
makes matters even more poignant is that I think Tiny knew his collapse was 
imminent.
<P>
On the very morning he received that nefarious missive, Tiny had been poring 
over other reader mail and rhapsodizing about--what else?--the Internet. I had 
stopped by <I>IU</I>'s offices to return the giraffe sketches Tiny had 
requested I take a look at. I told him the drawings were primitive and clearly 
revealed a disturbed psyche, to which Tiny informed me that they were 
actually the work of a nun in Toledo. She had been born without arms and had 
painstakingly created the giraffe likeness by assembling bits of ASCII text 
culled from several years' e-mail. "She pecks out URLs with her nose!" Tiny 
raved, clearly in awe. He then went on to praise the World Wide Web in almost 
religious terms: "Nothing separates geeks from would-be geeks like logging on 
and staying on. No one's going to log <I>me</I> off just for being 'idle' for 10 
minutes. I'll show those tyrants what 'idle' means." Tiny then slipped into his 
best-loved impression of indolence: taking off his snug T-shirt and belly 
dancing in front of the receptionist. A circle of applauding co-workers quickly 
formed around him.
<P>
Five minutes later, the letter arrived.     
<P>
Will Tiny be back? Apparently, the thick-skulled editors have left that in your 
hands. As if you'd take time away from <A HREF="http://spacepirate.com">Space Pirate</A> long enough to e-mail 
<I>IU</I> a "Tiny Rules" support message. Me, I'm going back to my cooing 
pretties, the pigeons, and work on our Eddie Cantor production number. But I 
know in my heart that Tiny, even in his current deranged state, still adores 
the Internet. Let's just hope you people, in your current deranged state, still 
adore him.
