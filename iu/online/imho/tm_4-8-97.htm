I think I've finally reached my Internet <A HREF="http://www1.stpaulshosp.bc.ca/stpaulsstuff/MRart/kneeart1.html">saturation point</A>. 
<P>
Everyone gets awfully riled up when discussing anything about the Net. On one side of 
the virtual fence are the Net <AHREF="http://netamorphix.com/">zealots</A> who believe the 
Internet is the greatest invention ever to see the <A HREF="http://www.doubleclickd.com/lightofday.html">light of day</A>. They wonder how in the world anyone 
ever managed without it. On the other side of the fence are the naysayers--convinced that 
the Internet is the <A HREF="http://www.klaaskids.inter.net/pg-0502.htm">devil's playground</A>: rampant with <A HREF="http://www.cybernothing.org/jdfalk/media-coverage/archive/msg02748.html">pornographic</A> offerings 
and chat room wife-stealing hucksters.
<P>
Me? I'm pretty <A HREF="http://cadre.sjsu.edu/switch_v1n1/JoeSquire/ambivalent.html">ambivalent</A> about all of it these days.
<P>
Sure, the Internet has a lot going for it. <A HREF="mailto:tdemayjr@mcs.net">E-mail</A> is probably 
the one singular piece of technology that has forever changed the way I'll communicate. 
And the proliferation of online zines and Web sites has been great for the dissemination 
of ideas (like the crap in this piece) . And if <A HREF="http://www.fc.net/phrack/under/misc.html">underground</A> 
and non-conformist ideas can be spread 
more efficiently, without <A HREF="http://www.fairus.org/member/newslett/bono.htm">interference</A> 
from corporate sponsors or without 
the pressures of huge operating costs, then I'm all for it. 
<P>
With that said, I must also add that the Net has not progressed into the great international 
soapbox that I had once hoped it would. As great as the online world is in many ways, I 
can also understand why some people are disappointed, even disgusted by it. I've seen 
stuff in my short Net-browsing life that would kill my <A HREF="http://www.vistek.com/pages/mother.htm">Mom</A>. (I'm not speaking figuratively.) And as 
always, when some unscrupulous person sees an opportunity to deceive and swindle 
someone else, especially in a cold and impersonal manner, of course they're going to 
exploit it. But that's not the Internet (despite what <A HREF="http://www.chatsoup.com/daily_dish/bi06.10.html">Ann Landers</A>
 would have you believe.) That's 
human nature. 
<P>
Not that I really even care. I can't feel passionate about the Net these days. Maybe it has 
to do with the fact that I spend too much time working with it. Our magazine is singularly 
focused on online culture. If that weren't bad enough, everyday I have to be reminded of 
it on the way to and home from work. When driving, I'm bombarded with 
<A HREF="http://www.enemy.org/">Microsoft</A> billboards. And when I sit down in front of 
the tube, I'm confronted with Web addresses that pop up at the end of every other 
television commercial. Even on the radio, which I hardly listen to anymore these days, 
DJs utter more www's than a rabid <A HREF="http://www.wbanimation.com/cmp/porkshok.htm">Porky Pig</A>. It sort of sickens me, and makes me 
want to curl up in my little <A HREF="http://www.anca.gov.au/plants/manageme/platnest.htm">burrow</A>,
 like some Kafkain protagonist.
<P>
The Net is not ruling my life right now. OK, so I spend way too much time on battle.net 
playing Diablo (damn those game creators at Blizzard!). And I do sort through the 100 
odd messages I receive daily from the music mailing lists I subscribe to and assorted 
other e-mail. But I'd like to think these things are not what define me.
<P>
Maybe I'm waiting for something big to happen--something that will force the Internet 
out of its current corporate-induced stagnation and into the highly <A HREF="http://www.anarchy-online.com/">anarchistic 
forum</A> of free thought that it was supposed to 
be. I'm waiting for it to fulfill my expectations of a <A HREF="http://www.altx.com">publishing</A>
 and intellectual revolution.
<P>
But I'm really impatient.
