"Inquiring minds want to know. I want to know." 
<P>
Tired of the same old news briefs that clutter my oft-neglected inbox--the kind of briefs that 
detail such <A HREF=http://www.mbayaq.org/hp/hp_kelpcam.htm>boring</A> things as 
corporate personnel changes, Web server software and the latest in health related home pages--I 
decided to scavenge the Net for some of the good stuff. I'm talking about tabloid news.
<IMG WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=136 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="art/satan.gif" ALT="meter-satan" VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5> 
<P>
Forget about professional news services. Who cares about Clinton's trip to Mexico to sign 
agreements on drugs and immigration? I have an inquiring mind--I want to know about Sonny 
Bono's skirt-chasing escapades, LBJ's love nest and the ghost of Wolfman Jack. The Net is a 
gossipmongers treasure trove, inhabited by hundreds of sleazy tabloid correspondents eager to 
dish out the latest and most scandalous in world news dirt (insert Current Affair pyramid sound 
effect here). 
<P>
Where to start? Well, nobody can seem to get enough news about the ongoing JonBenet Ramsey 
murder investigation. The death of little JonBenet has sparked the creation of a number of in-depth Web pages--and we're not above looking at all of them. Make the <A 
HREF=http://www.joshua-7.com/jonbenet.htm#JonBenet>JonBenet Murder Investigation 
Page</A> one of your newest bookmarks. The author of the site has a morbid interest in the case 
and has posted autopsy reports, the latest cover stories from the major tabloids, weekly 
investigation developments, a discussion group and info that suggests that Patsy Ramsey may 
have written the infamous ransom note while in a multiple personality state. 
<P>
Tasteful tabloidians (oxymoron?), who shy away from such news tripe, may prefer England's 
sophisticated <A HREF= http://www.anorak.co.uk/>Anorak</A>. Here, you can read about an 
exploding rat that set fire to a Brit couple's 400-year-old thatched cottage in rural Puddledock, or 
a new Russian band that's fashioning itself after the Spice Girls. Can you say, "Spiceski Girls?" 
<P>
Anorak is not alone in its fine reporting: <A HREF="http://www.tabloid.net">Tabloid News</A>, 
a brazen crusader of truth and justice in politics, offers "100 percent real" news briefs. The byline-less stories, cranked out in a rat-infested San Francisco office, follow the three basic tenets of 
ethical tabloid reporting: <I>1)</I> Liars, frauds and bores must be punished, <I>2)</I> HEADLINES MUST BE 
EXTREMELY LARGE, <I>3)</I> The voice of outrage is the enemy of evil. With this ideal in mind, the 
writers at Tabloid, veteran reporters of <I>Prognosis</I> (a European tabloid), have broken 
stories about cross-dressing killers in San Francisco, a "Portuguese Disco Inferno" and "Foul 
Nabisco Snacks." There's absolutely no story published at Tabloid with any kind of impartiality--and we appreciate this honest approach to news reporting. There's nothing worse than a 
newspaper that purports objectivism, and then addles its copy with subtext.

<P>

And who could forget <A HREF=http://www.nationalenquirer.com>The National Enquirer</A>, 
the big daddy of tabloid slop. The paper's home page provides users with teasers to their latest 
exclusives, as well as a few touching human interest pieces. I couldn't help but shed a tear...of 
laughter while reading "Begging For Beer Pays Better Than Working For Food," a tale about truth 
in advertising. 
<P>
And for a smattering of newsmongering scuttlebutt, also be sure to check out the <A HREF=http://www.planetary.net/robots/enquirer.html>Supermarket Tabloid Headline Generator</A>. 
<P>
***Warning*** Keep in mind that not all sites maintain the same level of integrity in their reporting. 
In fact, many tabloid sites are parodies of the real deal. While headlines like, <A HREF=http://www.cruzio.com/~djj/WWC/WWC.html>"I Got a Parking Ticket From Satan,"</A> <A 
HREF=http://c3f.com/ntytoday.html>"Starving Children Eat Sally Struthers," and 
"Thanksfuckinggiving"</A> sound like legitimate news stories, they're actually just pranks made 
at the expense of Net users. 
<P>
When and if you have any doubt to the verity of a tabloid news item, drop a line to <A HREF=http://www.well.com/user/mason123/bsiweb2.htm>The BackStreet Investigators</A>, the 
infamous L.A. trio who're renowned for their trash-can exploits and for pissing off Hollywood 
celebrities.
