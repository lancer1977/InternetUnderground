Fifteen years ago last August, <A HREF="http://www.mtv.com">Music Television</A> hit the air (or cable) with its 24-hour a 
day barrage of music videos. <A HREF="http://tiger.coe.missouri.edu/~patrick/buggles/">The Buggles</A> christened the network with their shoestring 
budget offering "Video Killed the Radio Star," causing many to ponder the potential 
power of this new medium. The early days were packed with small-time bands hoping to 
make it big in the industry. The cheesy videos that followed entertained as well as opened 
the minds of many. After being labeled as "too insular" by critics, the network opened up 
and created avenues for more geographically and socially localized musical styles to go 
mainstream. Across the nation, young adults were exposed to types of music through 
MTV that they might otherwise never have heard. Is it possible that rap music would 
have become popular among so many white suburban and small-town youths without the 
help of powerful images and the mighty "VJ"s? 
<P>
Over the years, the network changed. The big bands caught on to the power of the music 
video and began pumping huge budgets into 3-minute clips. Style snubbed substance. 
New bands hoping to make it big through MTV were relegated to late-night showcases 
unless their videos had that "certain something" to make them "Buzz Clips."
<P>
Finally, someone saw the potential to cash in big-time on the ultra-hip mystique that 
surrounded the network. Non-video shows like "Remote Control" found their way onto 
the air. Advertisers were much easier to woo when a rock-solid slot during a 30-minute 
show was available. Now if you switch on MTV, you're likely to see <A HREF="http://www.grrl.com/real.html">anything</A> <I>but</I> 
a music video.
<P>
Maybe you see where I'm going with this; <I>IU</I> is an Internet magazine, after all. 
True, the Internet was not created as a money-making venture. But you'd hardly know 
that now.
<P>
As recently as 1995, the number of commercially motivated Websites was still small 
enough to make them a conversation topic in many chat rooms and IRC channels (no 
JAVA chats in those days). I remember being dazzled and delighted by <A HREF="http://www.joeboxer.com">Joe Boxer's</A> site, 
and amazed that <A HREF="http://www.coca-cola.com">Coke</A> had its own domain name (www.coca-coloa.com). Guinness had a Web 
ad for its beer, hosted on what seemed to be a private users site, and Ameritech (a phone service 
provider for much of the Eastern United States) sported a tilde before its corporate name.
<P>
The Web was a tangle of personal offerings and free everything. Nearly all sites were 
personal sites, lovingly created and tended by Webmasters in their spare time. A small 
community existed, watching as <A HREF="http://www.richuish.ac.uk/newbie.htm">"newbies"</A> began to flood the public areas, demanding 
assistance from everyone with a kewl handle. I was ecstatic: My job security depended on 
the Internet's increased importance in the world. My biggest fear was that the skeptics 
were right about its being "just a fad."
<P>
Now I go home and watch TV, no longer exclaiming my joy at each URL posted at the 
bottom of the screen, and wonder whatever happened to some of the great sites from just 
a year ago. Sites that lambasted companies and their products. Sites like the LegoWars 
Home Page, which offered rules to a crazy game based on all those Space <A HREF="http://www.gyugyi.com/renegades/renegade_legos.html">LEGOs</A> from 
the early '80s. These sites have been threatened off the Web by corporations waving 
lawsuits and legal papers. Those same corporations then park their bloated, bandwidth-
sucking JAVA applets on the graves of the truly inspired sites that exist now only in our 
memories...and, we hope, on backup floppies somewhere.
<P>
It's great that money is being pumped into the Net and its infrastructure by these 
companies. In order not to strangle itself, the Net needs to keep growing to support the 
huge number of new users appearing online everyday. But what happens when the 
corporations start holding the purse-strings over everyone's head? We've seen it happen 
on network television. An advertiser threatens to drop its ads because it doesn't like the 
content of a show and, poof, no more show. If you don't see that happening online, take a look at 
<A HREF="http://www.vcalpha.com/silicon/episteme.html">Infinity Void</A>.
<P>
Silicon Toad, the site's webmaster, has been doing a lot of moving around lately. Infinity 
Void is featured in this month's <A HREF="/iu/webguide/">WebGuide</A> as our top pick of hacking sites. But in the few 
weeks since that review was written, Silicon Toad has been forced off the server that had 
been hosting him. His previous host demanded that he include ad banners on his site, and 
when he refused, he found that he no longer had access to his own files. A concession was 
made, Silicon hit the highway and the corporate site allowed a forwarding URL to remain 
in the place of his old site.
<P>
When the Web becomes nothing more than cable TV, with its 50 networks and 3 public 
access channels, a place for infomercials and cookie-cutter entertainment for the 
"masses," where will the people who have been escaping by going online for the last ten 
years turn? Maybe we should follow MTV's lead. Fifteen years to the day that MTV hit 
the satellites, M2, the new all music video counterpart to MTV, debuted. Apparently 
enough people complained about the change in programming, but the network couldn't 
give up its solid advertising income. A solution was presented. Those lucky few who 
have access to M2 reap the rewards.
<P>
Maybe there will someday be a Web2: personal computers in basements and spare 
bedrooms all over the world, linked by second (or third) phone lines. In the spirit of the 
early Internet, a new network protocol could be devised and software circulated. We 
could then, once again, enjoy content so jam-packed with the sort of personal passion that 
made the Web the intellectual escape hatch we'd come to love, and there would simply be 
no room for ad banners.
