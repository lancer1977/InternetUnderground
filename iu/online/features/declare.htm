Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and<BR>
steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the<BR>
future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome<BR>
among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.<BR>
<P>
We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I<BR>
address you with no greater authority than that with which liberty<BR>
itself always speaks. I declare the global social space we are<BR>
building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to<BR>
impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess<BR>
any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.<BR>
<P>
Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.<BR>
You have neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you.<BR>
You do not know us, nor do  you know our world. Cyberspace does not<BR>
lie within your borders. Do not think that you can build it, as though<BR>
it were a public construction project. You cannot. It is an act of<BR>
nature and it grows itself through our collective actions.<BR>
<P>
You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did<BR>
you create the wealth of our marketplaces. You do not know our<BR>
culture, our ethics, or the unwritten codes that already provide our<BR>
society more order than could be obtained by any of your impositions.<BR>
<P>
You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use<BR>
this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these<BR>
problems don't exist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are<BR>
wrongs, we will identify them and address them by our means. We are<BR>
forming our own Social Contract . This governance will arise according<BR>
to the conditions of our world, not yours. Our world is different.<BR>
<P>
Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought<BR>
itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications.<BR>
 Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not<BR>
where bodies live.<BR>
<P>
We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or<BR>
prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station<BR>
of birth.<BR>
<P>
We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her<BR>
beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into<BR>
silence or conformity.<BR>
<P>
Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and<BR>
context do not apply to us. They are based on matter, There is no<BR>
matter here.<BR>
<P>
Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order<BR>
by physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened<BR>
self-interest, and the commonweal, our governance will emerge . Our<BR>
identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions. The<BR>
only law that all our constituent cultures would generally recognize<BR>
is the Golden Rule. We hope we will be able to build our particular<BR>
solutions on that basis.  But we cannot accept the solutions you are<BR>
attempting to impose.<BR>
<P>
In the United States, you have today created a law, the<BR>
Telecommunications Reform Act, which repudiates your own Constitution<BR>
and insults the dreams of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison,<BR>
DeToqueville, and Brandeis. These dreams must now be born anew in us.<BR>
<P>
You are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a<BR>
world where you will always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you<BR>
entrust your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are<BR>
too cowardly to confront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments<BR>
and expressions of humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are<BR>
parts of a seamless whole, the global conversation of bits. We cannot<BR>
separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings beat.<BR>
<P>
In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United<BR>
States, you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting<BR>
guard posts at the frontiers of Cyberspace. These may keep out the<BR>
contagion for a small time, but they will not work in a world that<BR>
will soon be blanketed in bit-bearing media.<BR>
<P>
Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate<BR>
themselves by proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to<BR>
own speech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas<BR>
to be another industrial product, no more noble than pig iron. In our<BR>
world, whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and<BR>
distributed infinitely at no cost. The global conveyance of thought no<BR>
longer requires your factories to accomplish.<BR>
<P>
These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same<BR>
position as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination<BR>
who had to reject the authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We<BR>
must declare our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty, even as we<BR>
continue to consent to your rule over our bodies. We will spread<BR>
ourselves across the Planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts.<BR>
<P>
We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be<BR>
more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.<BR>
