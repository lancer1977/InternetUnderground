Time for a little BBQ.

<P>

While you idle away the hours beside your power-sucking GE air conditioner, hidden from the scorching, torporific heat of 
the summertime sun, consider burning a few thousand joules thinking about the Flame <I>IU</I> contest. Now is the time to 
take us to task, and tell us why we're lame. If you don't happen to think we're lame, then just project your 
earthly frustrations on us. We welcome the beating. Mercilessly smack us like a Kathie Lee pi&#241;ata at a 
Honduran sweatshop worker's B-Day party.
<P>
All you have to do is e-mail or snail mail in an entry that rips our magazine a new one. The most thoughtful, 
creative and original flames will be posted here at the site (we reserve the right to edit, discard, be disgusted 
with and emotionally disturbed by all entries)--and the "primo" flame will actually be printed in our 
September newsstand issue. The grand prize winner will also receive all back issues of <I>IU</I> (even the 
rare issue #1), as well as a pound of <I>IU</I>'s favorite office candy (to be determined). Please refrain from 
using expletives and from threatening bodily harm to our fragile editors. Most of all, please make no 
comparisons between <I>IU</I> and Alf, Yanni, Gallagher, Kenny G., Urkel, Howdy Doody or <I>Leonard Part VI</I>--we would 
consider that hitting below the belt. 
<P>
Thanks, and good flaming!<BR>
